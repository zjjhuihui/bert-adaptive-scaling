tier_1	comments
else	Send email updates of progress of ticket.  Parts shipped, etc.
else	No complains, Engineer came and found the issue. After placed an order which took 2 days and it was installed on next day.. No compalins.
else	Repair wasn't completed before machine was returned, this should have occurred.
else	Inform the customer of updates on service. I had to call after 30 days of not hearing from the company in regards to my product. And then I still didnt receive the product back until after 60 days.. they should send emails and let the customer know the status of the service.
else	Response was slower than I expected by 3-4 days, and as a result, I did not receive the replacement phone before I had to leave town.
else	Not send these surveys until I've at least received the device back
else	Didn't receive further email as mentioned over phone for postage instructions.
else	Keep sufficient stock of spare parts and communicate and confirm when thr engineer can call.
else	this laptop for me is SUCK at all, please check with the record, its been 3-4 time been replace with the parts.
else	The technical support telephone experience was not comprehensive enough to resolve my issue.  A technician was sent to my house to solve the issue but it could have been handled over the telephone.
else	Answer there phone when trying to speak to someone. Constantly ringing out.
else	My laptop was sent back 2 times and problem was not fixed
else	Give me some more informative updates along the way
else	3 weeks later, the replacement product has still not shipped, despite 3 calls requesting a status update.
else	Send the proper parts to the technician the first time. Time with technician was extremely lengthy and required two total visits because wrong part was sent for day 1.
else	Need to work on Timeline for part delivery.
else	Perhaps, more regular updates on the process of the service
else	It will be better if on site service should come with some essential spare parts.
else	"Tell customer what the problem (specific hardware failure, software updates, etc.) was and what was done to fix it. The online status page should contain more information, rather than simply state ""repair on hold for part."" You could state which part so the customer will be informed. For most of us, purchasing a ThinkPad X1 Yoga (or similar) is a significant investment."
else	better response time for premium product!
else	Lenovo Ships out the part which arrives next business day, but we do not get an IBM technician until days later.  We pay for next business day service.  This is really frustrating.
else	You could update the online return status update, or provide tracking numbers when products are returned so you know when to expect them. And to use appropriate size boxes with proper packaging to ensure the products make it back safely and undamaged. I am glad it was a tower rather than a laptop or it would surely have cracked the screen. The return packaging was by far the worst I have ever seen from any online/catalog purchase.
else	I own a laptop and a phone, updates for the phone's firmware are not forthcoming. The first lenovo laptop I bought broke within the warranty period...not impressing at all
else	Was given incorrect information initially about being able to return product through BestBuy. When called back was told that was incorrect. Next representative told me would have to be sent into depot. First call resolution isn't important if issue isn't actually resolved. Would like an ETA or more communication from Depot when they have my product.
else	support engineer knowledge is very poor,but they do .
else	technician had poor communication, late by a day, resolved tickets without the issue being resolved, told us a part would be shipped overnight and it wasnt
else	3* battery drain fastly after the new update
else	improve the parts manufacture more
else	Dissatisfied that I received a new phone that the touch screen didn't work on. Satisfied in being able to get a quick turn around on a replacement device.
else	Fix your complex online support presence, its veru hard to follow and very disjointed to find out what applications can update what. Redundantlenovo support  apps create issues on my laptop
else	Don't ship fragile parts in flimsy boxes that get beat up by your couriers.
else	I do not receive pictures?? Maybe settings problem if u could help Thanks, Chris.
else	tech should have parts.   phone represents should be able to access e tickets
else	We are not technical person, So we can not do trouble shoot as per instructions because require software and Hardware not available on same time (Exp. Windows installation and extra Hardware equipment).. So we can expecting help beyond as per guidance from your end.
else	Resolve the problem in a more acceptable time frame, be more willing to replace the device when several parts fail at once, test that the issue is resolved once a technician replaces a part onsite rather than simply assuming that it is, send surveys once the issue is resolved rather than whilst the case is still open
else	Have more parts available in my area, and this type of thing used to be user-replaced, not requiring complete disassembly
else	Streamline the resolution of customer complaints
else	A new and more serious problem occurred due to the refurbished replacement part!!!
else	Order correct parts, scheduling, customer service takes ownership of case, followup, techs arrive when scheduled
else	speed of processing the product return, and shipping the replacement product
else	Please return my original hard drive and respond to my formal complaint
else	Put your phone number in the paperwork that is with the laptop.  Had no way of using my laptop to access the website. Had to call a friend.
else	waiting for warranty to be reset
else	Increase inventory of parts or have the parts shipped faster.
else	1.  Make it such that I don't need to return the device.2. Feedback on how the repair is going.
else	My computer was mailed on 6/27/2018 and not returned until 7/18/2018.  When I entered the case number on the website, no information came up.  Had to call and be placed on hold to get information.
else	to get support by phone to the correct department is a mess
else	Better quality control of replacement parts. 3 faulty motherboards is ridiculous.
else	Provide packaging for returns.
else	Please understand the technical issue clearly before giving the solution
else	When I initially chatted with tech support, I requested that I be sent a new cord. The tech insisted that I had a port problem. When I received my laptop back after 2 weeks it appears that all that was done was replace the cord.
else	Do what you say you are going to do and make it easier to contact Lenovo tech support.
Agent	Sometimes hard to understand the agent. Otherwise, no problems.
else	They did not return my wifi connector for the computer. The computer however does work for now.
else	Do not promise customers a new item then send a used part
else	Took long time (more than 2 weeks) for part to be available
else	Actually return consumer phone calls within 48 hours, as your customer servicers state. Process requests when requests are made. And explain situations thoroughly to ensure the customer understands why you are not able to process their request before they get off the line.
Agent	Improve the technical knowledge of the agents providing service to the customer.
else	inferior service quality, unnecessary making customer to wait for hours, Completely below standard technical team( not even aware about phone specifications and technologies involved), unpleasant attitude towards customer, creating other problems while correcting one.
else	The technical staff need better procedures to ensure faults are resolved before they return laptops so that a laptop does not need to be sent in 3 times to have a simple issue resolvedEnd users who have had poor experiences with getting issues resolved should be treated with a higher level of respect by customer service personnel When complaints are made about the service received, there should be accountability by the customer service staff to acknowledge poor service and apologise
else	Improve your technical respond as we are business user.
else	Talking on the phone to book in the repair was quite slow, as I was not told to make an account prior to the call and I was on hold for a while before this.
else	Improve on spare parts availability on next working day.
else	In past 6-7 months i need to visit lenovo service center 7 times every time they did same some format update and two times screen change still the problem doesn't resolve from root.
else	"Timely updates from onsite technician. Checking that device work after it is ""fixed"". Shorter phone wait times"
else	I brought the product with the issue, and i'm disappointed to took multiple chain of issues happened every time when another parts are replaced. So, good QA before ship the product will solve al these hassle.
else	The fact that you sent me a broken device, first pretend that it is a issue to get fixed in minimum time, I could have send device back for a refund and ordered another, which I would have got in a couple of days, instead as I said replacement it took more than a week (had to wait for device to be sent back and checked before replacement was sent out) why not just suggest I order a new one?
else	Speed and easiness of return
else	better call integration between departments. I had to make multiple calls to different departments only to find out it is not the department that handles technical support.
Agent	The hold time is too long.
else	Not let your technical support break my fucking computer.
else	send out the parts when they are promised
else	The process to replace my phone required that I either give a $400 security or wait until Motorola received my phone is ridiculous. I live in a very rural area and have a chronic illness and had no access to my phone for 3 1/2 days.
else	A resplacement since the laptop is really really loud at idle with temperatures around the 70s. While gaming, it gets to hovers between 94-98. Sometimes, the laptop is irresoponsive ever since the repair. My blue screening issue is fixed but my backlit keyboard wont light up now.
else	More professional.
else	I was facing below issue:-Earphone damagedDust particles in camera lensBoth were hardware issues But they said that fir raising request for earphones the need to delete all the data from my phone.I agreedBut after they returned my phone. I observed that they changed the software also.Some of the options are not available on my phone now after visiting the service center. Like1:-UI tuner option i cant enable2: while loading data in any app, one circular arrow is coming(reload icon)
else	Problem is intermittent and the parts replaced did not solve the problem.
else	solve the problem when you call your customer
else	When dealing with a no-boot scenario like mine, it might make your tech's life easier if you supply him with extra parts, like SSDs or RAM, in case the motherboard swap does not fix it. No blame on the tech, he cannot replace parts he hasn't got.
else	The technician that came (Choong) damaged the connector on the motherboard and ran off. I tried to call him but he wouldn't answer, so I had to call Lenovo and have someone else come back out again.
else	Send new parts - not used parts wasting everyone's time
else	The current model that we purchased has some technical glitch as per the Engineer
else	I have been told always part is not available and I have to wait for few weeks.
else	Fix and test the phone prior to returning it.  My phone still cannot connect to my carrier.
else	wrong parts delivered first time
else	Please try to make better hardware and laptop body part
else	Upon the return of the computer there was no pass word forwarded to ether my  e-mail address or my  daughters
else	Improve communication by notifying me before sending out a part to my address.
else	Repair my laptop free of charge
else	Faster resolution of issue.
else	no one came
else	Solve the problem on time, rather than being lazy...
else	provide tracking number for shipping box
else	It would save a lot of time and effort on all sides if the support tickets could be submitted online instead of on the phone. There was a mix up on what department should handle our product and we kept being transferred back and forth, waiting half an hour between representatives each time. One of those departments had stated we should wait 2 days to be contacted by a technician. When we called for an update two days later,  we found out our support ticket had been cancelled (!) without giving us any notification, so we had to submit a new ticket with a different department. All in all, a very bad and confusing experience for what should have been a next business day, on-site repair.
else	Eng should have basic knowledge before coming to site
else	the wrong part was sent the first time
else	Give feedback on the created service ticket, give notification more than 15 minutes ahead of the arrival of the service man.Fix the problem, instead of creating more (see the follow up ticket).
else	Tablet never appeared in your tracking system. Repair further damaged the product and I received it back with wires sticking out of it
else	Have past 14 days but still no update as promise in Sammy Shang email dated 25 Jun 2018.
else	Provide better updates on the ETA of the engineer
else	It took very little time to receive a new phone once I sent mine in.
else	As I said I had this computer for 7 months use it 2 times a week speakers stopped working they could not fix it taking control of my unit via internet so I had to send it in. Get it back speakers are all crackly and cut in and out so I had no computer for 2 weeks only to get it back with a terrible fix!
else	i understand an intermittent problem is hard to trouble shoot, hopefully they will completely7 replace the unit this time
else	Better shipping standards in regards to packaging replacement parts, specifically fragile parts.
else	Stop the background noise so I can hear the tech clearly.
else	in this scenario particularly /log control with a faulty part - better process - for a faster outcome 9 out of 10 is a faulty part took 10 days/ in addition address was picked up wrongly, this might be the biggest issue but not sure.
else	This was the worst service I have ever received, slowest and least acceptable, from any customer service in my life. Especially considering costs.
else	The first LCD sent was the wrong part.  Apparently this model was produced with many different LCDs and there was not a quick way to determine the proper part required.
else	the problem reoccurred as soon as i opened my computer
else	Long time taken for resolution
else	I submitted a form requesting clarification on resolving a problem with my laptop.  Instead of a reply, o received a call from someone stating they were on their way to my house to fix the problem.  They should have scheduled the service call instead of just planning to stop by.
else	provide extended warranty of the parts replaced
else	Make rma process better/easier from third parties like ASI
else	Stock more parts in local area.
else	Faster sparpart delivery & feedback to the service. It took two weeks to have the sparepart and the tests are still ongoing and waiting for manufacturer's feedback.
else	Just be a little quicker with phone time waiting..
else	Lern how to give service to customer and better product rather than faulty part
else	Proper information regarding who could do repairs and faster mail service.
else	Slow response times, back-ordered parts, phone reps difficult to understand, constant calls, took 2+ months to resolve.
Agent	The Malaysia Service Centre at Tropicana or Serembam area not so good,  always busy &  follow up very bad.
else	please ensure they are technically sound . I have numerous tele conversation with Lenscare , they are not up to par . It is very sad Lenovo have such people to handed technical issue .
else	Proactively engage Windows to make them aware that their updates often times result in the failure of device drivers to upload properly.
else	Give uniform to all technical support
else	Wrong part installed.
else	waited too long and listened to too many automated messages before I got through to anyone who could help me.I am an older person and older people find  it     frustrating to be told to look at your website.If we wanted to look at your website we would not be phoning.
else	Ask to check and never got 2nd return call back.
else	"1.  Shorten the wait time on the ""live"" chat support.2.  Don't re-direct me back and forth between departments.3. Reply my email after I sent in the additional information requested.  It's been over 24 hours now since I sent the email, and still no response yet."
else	If you deliver a faulty product, your return or exchange policy should atleast be for a month, instead of 10days.
else	update your Guarantee database.
else	The technician should verify that all updates are done prior to leaving the service site. In this case, I had to do the updates after he left, and one of them was a firmware update that apparently did no download correctly, causing the computer to die (inoperative). This required a second board to be installed, which has performed correctly.
else	Time until contact was made for service was slow--however the tech that came on site was knowledgable about the issue and communicated well. He advised best plant to get the tablet back to full functioning status in the quickest manner and that was very much appreciated.
Agent	you must help to follow up the case in your end since the case is still not resolved unless you close the case without any confirmation to us.
else	During call telefon was cut
else	They called multiple times to reschedule as the part was ordered and sent to the wrong place.
else	First wrong part was shipped, then broken part was shipped. And communication has been slow.
else	need to improve in communication and technical support.
else	Fix the issue, the device is still not functional...As of late the service has been terrible...This is no fault of the technicians as they are doing the best they can...The problem is that parts are on back order, they've come in damaged and there appears to be a lack of available technicians to service the area...The service you provided used to be top notch...1 or 2 day turn around.  That is no longer the case...Very disappointing!
else	Faster times from the moment the call is connected to the moment an actual person is speaking to me.
else	Machine was returned in worse condition than before, now it's back again..
else	create a better partnership with a courier company
else	Faster turn around, times from logging the job to repair / anything more than 2 days is not ideal
else	Make computers that work and employ technical support staff. You're a disgrace.
else	Show up or maybe even call back when promised.. I was told a tech would call back in 24-48 hours to schedule a time to show up and I have NEVER been called or contacted AT ALL! I have had to call back.  I RESOLVED part of the issue by searching the Internet for 3 days to find a fix THAT I FOUND ON LENOVO WEBSITE!! I am disgusted at your customer service or lack there of, when I purchased a 3-year 24-hour onsite warranty.  I am now afraid for the next 3 years if this is what I can expect.
else	quicker resolution times ( 10 weeks from call logged to site visit not acceptable), logging and actioning site visit requests, not relying on me to police your support process.  Accurate communication of reported fault between support departments etc...
else	The battery drain issue is not resolved and became a reoccurring issue for this device. I have sumbbited the device again to service centre. top of it the front flash stopped working after i picked my device from service centre last time. Guys please replace the device as you are unable to fix the issue .  This is unacceptable from this device after spending 28000 this worked hardly 8 months and stopped working. Really disappointing.
else	Wrong parts delivered due to wrong serial number given by Lenovo backend
else	By re-structuring your warranty program to be more robust and feedback oriented.
else	Someone at the Home Office needs to get some protocol, process and training in place for the ticketing and scheduling and repair process.   Completely unorganized and unprofessional the way it was handled.   Please take note that the technician himself was fine and the low rating on arriving at scheduled time and amount of time it took to complete repair were NOT due to him but lack of organization on the scheduling side which did not set him up for success.
else	Promise your future customers that the return of their product will be safe by ensuring that your shippers know to obtain a signature prior to release. It is not good practice to leave customers' highly expensive products on their porch in frigid temperatures - therefore leaving it vulnerable to be taken by someone passing by, or being damaged by the frigid temperatures.
else	improve the speed of case creation to onsite / part delivery to onsite technician. It shouldn't take 7 days to get an onsite repair complete especially requiring escalation
else	The people serving customers at the cashier to be more clear and knowledgeable about the laptops.
else	Take time to read what the problem is I am having so you know to send the correct parts
Agent	The only thing I was disappointed in was that I never received a follow up email stating what was done. This is the first email (requesting I complete a survey) that I have received.
else	The Lenovo service center is number is not available online, this contact is I reached is based in Malaysia and unable to resolve my issue.
else	The pick up service was ridiculous and we were not kept updated.
else	The behavior of the front office employees was very rude and unprofessional.
else	Provide text message updates throughout the process.
else	I was told conflicting information about delivery times which would have meant I would have been without my machine for over a month and then the parts turned up the next day. The engineer who came out was excellent and very professional.
else	Despite having issues with the computer since the first day we received it. It took months for the solution center to show that the motherboard was defective and had complete hard drive failure. I have never had this issue with a new computer of any other brand. I was astounded I had to pay for shipping since the problem began the first time I started my new computer.
else	Keep parts on hand so there is less down time when my computer dies.
Agent	The only problem I had was that the person I spoke to uses English as a second language so we both had a bit of trouble understanding each other at times though they did try to be patient with me.
else	laptop has not been fixed after being returned four times
else	Did not request a call back / just notice the feedback
else	faster response time for premium product!
else	Bad behavior unprofessional attitude
else	The laptop returned from depot with same issue
Agent	Decrease hold times.
else	test your unit thoroughly in our case the stayed 1 month to end user then returned.
else	I did not receive confirmation that my computer was received. I mailed it to you and then about a week later it was returned to me fixed. I was very happy with the experience, but to know that it was received/being worked on and coming back would have been helpful.  Thank you!
else	By reducing the spare part management through quality testing and checking of the same
else	It was hard/time consuming to get to the right department on the phone.
else	Give better resolution rather than sending a defective part
else	It is not easy to find where to track my case progress on your website.
else	Improve communication regarding the status of my machine; it was gone for a month with no updates as to why unless I took the time to inquire. Also, actually fix the problem on the first try. I have to contact support and miss more productivity with my laptop gone.
else	The wait time I had to wait for a representative.
else	Hire more experienced service engineers that understood the problem clearly and supply parts with proper testing if they are refurbished because your new parts are faulty which really lead to user disappointment.
else	Give time frames for when replacement parts will arrive. Give on site technicians parts/ability to try more than one solution per visit. Tech had to come out 3 times to try 3 different solutions. None of which fixed the problem. I'm now waiting on a replacement CPU, which I have no idea when it will arrive.
else	I asked for my phone software update as it seem I had a problem with my 4g calling in Z2+ model. They just flashed my phone and restored it to the original version (i.e. back to marshmallow from nogurt) and after updating it again, the problem still persist.
else	Be able to provide real time updates via SMS.
else	Do not ever ship a BIOS update that can destroy ThinkPad system motherboards again. Test every BIOS update extensively before you release it.
else	Warranty was not updated in rhe lenovo website
else	Better coordination for parts follow-up: the replaced part was sent to us AND brought as well by the technician. Overall, it is easier when only the technician brings in what is needed.
else	attend the service call on time and and close it on time
else	spare parts replacement. Good to know the background.Starting with a refurbished part is not that good, even though warrantied.
else	Laptop was returned encrypted. it was not sent encrypted and I cannot access it now
else	This phone not properly update.. wi-fi and net .. automatically slow....
else	Awaiting the technician's return to finish the work.
else	Fix the problem, do not show up and walk away with the replacement part and leave us with a broken laptop. Need some kind of exception or something. The part needed was shipped to us by Lenovo, it was here. The on site tech showed up and walked away with it.
else	Pay for the $60 return postage. Provide explanation of why computer failed.
else	Completely resolve issues when laptop returned. Not return it with partial fix.
else	Provide updates and more info
else	There should have been no new damage to computer when it was returned.
else	Agent need more training on how to order parts and make sure whatever part were order has correct shipping address . Also Support person should ownership of the case and close case when actual parts deliver to customer.
else	No detail in emails, just that a package was received and then a package was sent.  No explanation to what happened with the phone and why it was not working
else	I got a new issue post part replacement.
else	It can make the repair faster. It is a really good thing that the repair facility is in North Bay Ontario which is a reasonable distance from everywhere on Canada.
else	"I have trouble with a lot of apps ""not responding"" or shutting down? Is there a solution?"
else	The first part was damaged so the technician had to come back a second time to replace the first part.  In the meantime, the origninal TS call, when I indicated there was a second part needing repair and he acknowledged it, as I feared he did not arrange for that part to be shipped.  Thus, on the second onsite visit, the tech did have the replacement for the damaged original replacement part and the replacement part that he ordered that the TS call recipient should have ordered.
else	Repair high end business laptops in a faster fashion, almost 2 weeks for one of your very expensive top end P51 laptops is shocking.Call centre support staff were either as helpful as they could be, or obviously didnt care.  Phone calls were not returned. And engineers did not turn up on the first day when they were supposed to both times.  I also was not told you were shipping the part to my address on the 2nd repair, it was pure chance I happened to be home when it was delivered...
else	Send parts that work.
Agent	less time on hold
else	Without feedback until now.
else	It took 5+ visits from service techs and ultimately had to send in to Service Depot to get system working again. Phone support was poor and management was entirely unhelpful in creating a timely resolution.
else	Requested instructions for CRU to be sent. Nonecame with it. Difficult to find video on website. The one found for T570 was out of date.
else	Still waiting for return and refund
else	Please make a call back to client to confirm their support satisfaction
else	Expedite the service and parts availability.
else	I had a damaged screen on my Motorola z2 force.During the subsequent calls to Motorola, I received 3 different replacement senerio and prices!
else	More training for your customer service reps especially in the technological issues department.
else	Quicker response, less paperwork for an obvious issue..
else	Deliver the parts ASAP
else	My replacement phone was returned in non-working condition.  I sent Motorola RMA my phone with a battery and stock battery cover.  Why were these essential parts not returned?  How am I supposed to use a phone without a battery?
else	1) FIx the spare parts delivery process so the client doesn't have manage your activities.2) Provide better quality parts.
else	I received my computer back after a month and it wouldn't boot. Worse shape than when I sent it.
else	faster repair, on time update
else	Correct information on the Lenovo service order tracking system. Return my device repaired without any new problems.
else	need to visited the engineer on time when ticket logged for the same
else	at list Lenovo should provide proper contact number so we should talk with right person.
else	You need to be really, really clear on how to download a product (such as MSOffice, where absolutely no instructions are given, nor any recognition that you have actually purchased and paid for it!).   I am also very disappointed that I had to pay for the anti-virus software that I had specifically asked - in the first instance - that it be included in the quote.
else	Provide better status updates to customer
else	Replace the computer, still have not received a shipping label to return for exchange. I have box for it already.
else	better communication on progress, and faster turn around time.
else	Provide better status updates. Repair took almost a month.
else	Send the correct parts, communicate about delays, timelines, etc.
else	Give updates on status and have knowledgeable people who answer phoned
else	Telephone no was supplied to Lenovoand there was no attempt on the company part to communicate. The issue has not been resolved and after 2 months from Purchase the Tablet has ceased to be operational
else	Too Long waiting for a simple part.
else	Faster return time. Updated communication about the problem. And resolution of actual problem.
else	Check the device properly before returning, because the laptop battery connected, and I had to give it for checking.
else	Train the service people who take the calls to understand better the replacement parts that are required ie if consumer or indeed the engineer is required to fit. As it was suggested that I could fit and when I saw engineer fit then I was glad I went for that option.
else	I have had this unit for approximately 3 months when I had a problem it would not boot up at all. I called about 4 times before someone finally made a ticket for Me to send it in. I sent it in and the time in the repair shop was short that was good accept it was apparently never checked out after the hard drive was replaced because it had someone else's   name in the original boot up area. I then called another 3 times before someone finally decided to send Me a boot thumb drive after installing this I am finally up and running.
else	Direct contact to customer care and use best supplier for laptop parts because my laptop screen damaged within 6 month after purchasing
else	I gave my mobile phone before 2 months at Motorola service center, but still there is no any update
else	Need to improve the speed of delivery of the parts
else	1) If you cannot get parts in a few days and I have 'next business day warranty' send me a replacement product (like Dell). 2) Send the technician with the parts (like Dell)  rather than posting the part and then assigning the technician, it just wastes time.
else	Less time waiting to connect to an actual person
else	Incompetence on Lenovo's end in sending the proper parts.
else	Reason  was that  I have a Sim card under my phone cover. But they not returned my sim card and say that go to sim store and take a new sim card.
else	Technicians are unable to resolve issue, product needs returned to pc service depot
else	Go back to having better phone support - it's been sub par for about 6 months, they don't even know the parts they are ordering so they don't bother to order it.  They need to have some basic equipment expertise.  The onsite tech though is great!
else	Speed up resolution time since I had to be without my work computer for more than 4 days.
else	The repair service was a LOT faster than I had anticipated, and they even shipped back the battery I accidently left in the phone. The batter got back to me within a day of the phone being officially logged into the repair system!
else	We seen repeated problems even after replacing the hardware parts, Lenovo need to cross check thoroughly before sending to customer's place
else	Regular updates. Support site is hard to find. Phone number for support is overseas. Had to dig into my text messages to find the 1800 number cause it was impossible to find on the site.
else	Listen customer properly then send parts
else	Perhaps make the Automated phone service be a bit more simpler and have a better phone connection.
else	parts to not take longer 4 to 6 weeks to arrive. Although my incident part didn't take long however,  they didn't all arive at once and caused delasy with having to wait fo the part to arrive and technician attending twice.
else	Late hour call-ins need better service.  I called in on 12-5-18 at 10:10 PM and was put on hold and finally hung up at 11:30 PM and all I ever heard was music and will be with you soon.  After finally giving up I hung up an using my other computer scheduled a call back for 8:45 AM the next morning.  The call back came at 7:15 in the morning which I missed since my phone is located not near my bedroom.   I then called back at app 9:00 AM the morning after my initiate call the evening before and the service was outstanding.  I would have scored Lenovo a ten based on that service and assistance but because of the evening prior I had to decrease my score.
else	Replacement part availability.
else	The representative I spoke to did not respond with clear answers to my questions and seemed extremely reluctant to give me any information about the logistics of using my warranty (which was my original question). He asked extremely inappropriate personal questions to the point that I was very uncomfortable with the amount of personal information and screenshare access I had given to diagnose and set up the service request. At one point he seemed to question the legitimacy of the malfunction I've been experiencing and pushed me to confirm whether the issue was now resolved, despite the fact that the problem is intermittent and would only be confirmed with further use.
else	The returned computer was keeping frozen up.

I kept saying, ""What would be the point of keeping the back of the phone without the rest of it? No, I returned the front, back, and battery!"" She needs to listen better. Everything was there on Saturday. But you could have saved at least a little money by putting the back of the phone in the same package as the front of the phone and the battery.""

else	Device return has damage and missing part
else	Still waiting for a pre paid postage label
else	Speed up the process from the initial contact for service.
else	Time period for replacement parts could be improved
else	English speaking phone centres. When I submit my information pre call the person who calls me should have that info available to them.

else	We are not satishfied with lenovo service .. we are a software company in growing stage and already have 8 Lenovo think pad but planning to switch to other hardware and my staff is puzzled and frustrated with the service your team provides
else	Fix the problem before you return the laptop? I have been without my laptop for weeks.
else	Again start by being truthful and honest. I have not spoken to Lenovo over the phone, this is an inaccurate statement, an untruth. Secondly, answer the emails I sent, I responded to you via email and until I chased you via the contact page, I did not hear back. You never answered by questions posed in the second email, I am still awaiting a response. Thirdly, admit that your software which I was directed to on your website does not work with my device when used with Windows 7 64bit, it seems it never will. Yet at the time it clearly stated it will. The software will install on Windows 7 64bit, but the drivers but it will never connect to my device, so it is a waste of time installing it.  I have gone an purchased a new device (an ASUS) and it work perfectly with Windows 7 64bit. If people ask I will recommend ASUS and not Lenovo.
else	Better stock of parts
else	Confirm update for engineer to attend onsite
else	Dear Lenovo Team and the People at the top management (if this feedback is going to them for their understandings and action)Improve the quality of your mother boards, first i had got it changed under the standard warranty last year and this year again i had to go thru the same under my extended warranty.. Hence we are given to understand that the Lenovo Laptops are substandard and are highly unreliable. I was suggested by the dealer who sold me the laptop, that i should buy an extended warranty so that in future if there are any complications in the hardware the warranty will cover it.. Thanks to the dealer but all thumbs down to the product.. Highly disappointed with the product substandard quality.why in the first place should i buy an extended warranty???  It means that i had paid half the cost of the mother board by means of buying ext wty.. to cover your product flaws??Truly unsatisfied with your product and Hope to never buy again any of Lenevo Products and please do not consider me being a brand ambassador !!!!Hiten SomaiyaM-7262025253
else	The laptop would not boot up after it was returned to me. Immediately, I created a new ticket (406GHND) and I still have not heard back regarding that ticket.
else	My first call to the support was not fruitful. However, the second call landed on to a gentleman who gracefully handled the situation and performed an excellent job.
else	Bad communication from LWT, repairman has attended 5 times. Staff member without laptop for a month
Agent	Better follow up and proactive. Inform me need to change motherboard. But no definite or estimated time frame. Call a few times but hotline wait time too long. Get to your CS and inform technician will call but never get call. At least can send me an email but also no email.  Only when I write directly to svc center to voice my dissatisfaction and immediately the following day send me a text message that my device is ready for collection.
else	Contact your business customers when they create tickets directly in your system. This was a routine part failure and my employee was without their main PC for an entire week.
else	Before closing Call Lenovo should speak to user about resolution given.
else	More communication, was told the part would take a couple of days to come in and then the engineer would arrange the visit. However we had to wait over a week for more communication after being told the part had been ordered.
else	Send engineers on time as your executive said that engineer will be sent by today but didnot come
else	Your onsite is terrible (apart from one tech who knows what he is doing, everyone else have no idea, I know more about Lenovo products than your techs), parts availability is terrible, witing times awful and this is all Premium support!
else	When ordering parts ensure what you say, I.e. it should be there in 2 days is actually the truth. I called after 2 days and the order had been delayed and then on the third day I checked to see where my part was and it had been cancelled. The consultant had to come on-site 3 times, desperate visits, just to resolve my issue because he didnt have the correct parts. Improve this please. I was without a computer for 1 week and I had work and an exam to complete. Poor experience. The technician was great though.

I have called and left voice mail for case manager and also emailed him.  Still no response.   His name is Jason 919-874-3006.
else	When my phone was acting up, I received a replacement. Awesome, I thought my problems were over UNTIL two weeks after getting my replacement did I notice it had glitches. I contacted Motorola and it took months to get another replacement for problems that should not have been occurring on a new phone. I just feel that it was a problem that took way too long to fix. I now have my newest replacement and so far so good.
else	The computer has returned with a bitlocker on it and I cannot access any of the files
else	Improve BIOS updates and software.
else	Reduce waiting time, keep me updated. Repairs have only been completed after calling for status request.
else	prepare more spare parts for technician to replace
else	"Don't refuse to forward me to technicians who can address my very specific technical questions. Don't keep sending hardware randomly and make field technicians dance because you won't address the problem in a serious manner. Don't ship packages to one of my clients' addresses with another of my clients' company names on the label. Don't repeat that error after I've spent half an hour on the phone with someone who promises to fix this specific, additional, inexcusable blunder. Don't then forward my call to three more people in a row who won't address my issue. When I call what looks like a corporate number, don't act as if tech support has nothing to do with you and put me back at the beginning of the voice prompt at ""tech support"" when it's already been two weeks and change. Don't promise a callback from ""Corporate"" on Friday and make me call back on Tuesday because you have failed at that simple action. Don't close case number 405Z63Z as if you've done something and open case number 4063HH8 as if administrative thrashing were your only skill. When I ask for a manager because I've spoken to eight people who refuse to take charge, GET ME A MANAGER, and don't make me listen to you read case notes as a prerequisite to that simple demand as if you're don't something useful. When you refuse to get someone serious on the phone, don't say have a wonderful day and hang up. Twice. Within three days' time. And DO NOT blame any of this on the excellent field technician; she had the only idea of any substance in all of this. And finally, if you call yourselves tech support, BE tech support. Focus."

else	Read the ticket submission correctly, which detailed the part I needed.

else	"when shipping replacement parts directly to the customer instead of to the tech person, the shipping label never includes the ""attention to""... it arrives in our facility and our mailroom/receiving dept has no idea who the package belongs to.  I've mentioned it to your help desk, but they don't seem concerned.  Also the online MTSA website for creating New Service Requests, I would like to delete some of the contact information, but I don't see that option, I've asked some of the dispatchers when I call in, but they don't know how."

else	Better contact
else	Laptop not updated even after requsting.
else	Be better reachable, communicate in your team and update the customer
else	The issue we had was hardware issue and Lenovo are not able to tell which part of faulty. What they can do to speed up the process, is to bring the entire machine to site and replace it until problem resolved.
else	lots of paper work/ they have lots of units / could be faster
else	The quality of the part is in question as the laptop was not charging. I know the power supply was good but the battery could have been faulty or the newly installed system board was bad.
else	Waiting for technician to contact me.
else	When you say you will call back after the weekend  to fix the simple issue you couldnt resolve after multiple attempts previously. Then you could actually call back rather than not follow up or keep to your promise. (Call back when you say you will)
else	Reiterating the previous comment: Use full addresses when shipping.  Too many incidents of delayed returns because you failed to include the full address of my location.
else	We received a phone to replace one that went bad after 6 months. Received timely!
else	Keep people updated about how long it is going to take
else	It was hard to get correct call number from your website.
else	you can improve the distinction between your product parts so that you do not send out the wrong parts for repair in my case you sent the wrong screen out and my repair could not be done on site. i was then required to send it end and your company could not find information on my device and it took a total of 3 weeks to get my machine back
else	It's been over a month and I am still waiting for a supervisor to contact me as promised.
else	1. Dont transfer me from department to department 2. Actually solve my issue and stop making me run around
else	Keep customers up to date and also liaise with the shipping company better to assure product is collected and returned in a timely manner.
else	no response received
else	wrong part was sent even thou the required part was clearly communicated.  Tech had to request the part and make another trip out
else	Till today no updates on the quote for repair.
else	Have to improve a lot, this request was taken almost a month due parts are not available in store, keep maintain in stock well.
else	Provide an advance exchange or new replacement for units that originally ship with a defect.
else	The attendent was very unprofessional and my mobile problems still remains
else	less hold time on phone
else	As I said in the previous statement, improve the packaging quality on return items. If the pc is broken when it returns (for a different reason) it defeats the purpose.
else	Get the parts in stock and get better engineers
else	The solutions suggested to our problem were not appropriate and when I mentioned consulting the Australian Consumer Law ALL correspondence was ceased by your staff. Not really acceptable! Now our replacement laptop is displaying the same problem as the initial one!
else	Still awaiting feedback on my son's Ipad repair
else	Please provide us with updates, send us emails on the ETA of the order. Engineers should give us a call to update us on when they are expected to arrive (not 30 minutes to an hour before, as we had to adjust our schedule especially meetings to cater to the engineer coming on site). The engineer also specified that we should be the one arranging this with the engineer, but how are we meant to do that if we don't know their phone number.
else	Have more technical experienced call center personell.
else	The gentleman who came with the replacement motherboard came with a faulty unit. We have had similar incidents with a lot of our service requests and I think my boss is about to send an email to raise this issue with our Lenovo account manager.
else	Stand by more parts for onsite support incase the parts is not appropriate or wrong parts model.
else	Not take 4 days to respond after I paid for premium support. I ended up resolving the issue myself.
else	The phone I had had better camera and screen resolution. The replacement device although was mentioned an upgrade had low resolution camera than the one I had and the screen resolution was way lower too.
else	Avoid system update crashes
else	Nobody contacted me
else	By not calling daily for feedback.
else	Well, Just improve your timing of service for replacement of part. Because i have taken follow-up to Lenovo support for etlist 1 week and Then i get the proper solution. Actually this type of follow-up should has been by your side to setisfy the customer.
else	Explanation of what the repair or repairs would entail. My unit just wouldn't fire up or open the computer. Deemed loos parts (???) Never explained what, why, or how they would have been loose except from the manufacturing process.  What was the most disappointing of the process you've wiped out my programs. Such as my  browser, favorites, Office, personal files, pictures, security, trouble shooting apps, documents saved, etc. Returned with just the installed package of Windows 10. Originally told over the phone this would not happen. Then never mentioned in the return info document. This creates an additional cost/expense on my part to have these essentials replaced.
else	The laptop was returned but still faulty so has had to go back again.
else	your service provider partner not good
else	Waiting for a call to replace my other part.
else	Improve your shipment of parts
else	Replace Quality parts
else	Stop calling 3 times per day to follow-up on emails. I have a full-time job.Bounce my request to a service center, so that I now have to spend 4 hours going there without any idea of what the next steps are.
else	Some technical engineers/ workers can't speak English and can't understand English, so it was difficult to communicate with them.
else	I received a machine that was broken from the time I took it out of the box. Staff refused to fix it under warranty.Fixing it would cost as much as buying a new laptop. This was my 2nd Lenovo purchased. I will never purchase another.
else	You missed my power adapter, never received back even after I complained about it..
else	Not make customers wait for multiple weeks to repair broken product
else	Maybe you need to have telephone Contacts at Paya Lebar Servlink as there are no Phone nos. for contact.
else	we received the computer back but on the work preformed there was nothing done. Please advise
else	Wrong serial number and model led to weeks of delay to an eventual closure of the case without resolution
else	Make sure the laptop goes to the correct return address, 6911 Creditview Road,  and not the Warehouse at 6901 Creditview Road.   It ends up on a Purolator skid and gets shipped to the warehouse.   We are not notified the laptop has been returned and it gets lost.
else	The support claim that there is no issues with my laptop from the diagnostic report but still insisted on doing a factory reset over the phone. His tone wasn't nice and wanted me to do it immediately over the phone when I haven't had the chance to do any backup.
else	If the product fails from no fault of the consumer, the warranty process should include local brick and mortar for returning.  Also there should be no additional cost to have same day expedited service.
else	Prompter notification of machine being returned
else	Improve your next day onsite service response time.  Also, improve the premier follow-up support.
else	the parts waiting time
else	Your turn around time for regular Depot service is way to slow for a school district.  (Going to your regular Kentucky repair/depot facility.)  We have over 1000 Lenovo Chromebooks in our school, and some repairs have taken almost 3 months!   This will cost you business with Schools!
else	Not be transferred to so many people.
else	Please cross check any part  properly before sending to customer end.  In my case I got the working/ good HDD 3rd times arrival. rest 2 times I got faulty HDD also checked  & confirmed by service engineer. It will save time, resources, and extra expense for delivery many times of same part for lenovo & customer satisfaction for time bound resolution.
else	I received my new replacement phone very quickly and there were no problems with exchange
else	Don't charge to return an item under warranty. Better repair times.
else	Laptop has same error code and is not working
else	Return calls and let customer know whats going on.I have yet to hear from you guys about my non functioning Lenovo laptop.
else	Don't bring/send only the most likely part, but enough to fix it, if it isn't the most likely part.
else	Take full onwership of fix, please ask me to call another department for a replacement.
else	Firstly, I  would like to inquire why do you sell a computer with window 10 and there is no space for update for a 32G computer.?Windows 10 ,lastest security updates always pop up. I have email to your service online  and was told  that I can purchase a micro sd for the space issue.When I went to the service center the gentlemen who assist me was saying the the micro sd cannot be use to update of windows 10. ?And the only way to resolve the space issue was to do a recovery for the computer.The next day I went to the center to do the recovery/reboot. It took me more than 5 hours which 1 1/2 hours was wasted as the USB you gave us was not working properly.Now the issue of the window update is still not solved and the lastest pop up is Activate Windows?It was a big disappointment to purchase this computer as the person who sell this computer do not explain properly.He said that I can use to watch video and do emails like every other computer and even suggested to  me to purchase Microsoft words . which i was glad that I did not purchase as there no space.I hope to hear from you soon to resolve the above problemsRegards
else	On time resolution is required
else	I two years i sent my laptop  for repair 3 times and i fee to send it for 4th time because problem not solved yet
else	Late delivery,poor technical skills and tampered my mobile phone board
else	Phone support wait time to get a rep on the line was a little long.
else	better follow up, techs have been unable to find the FRU for the part  3 incident tickets opened.  First 2 were never completed or received a call after first tech was on site and could not locate the correct.  Over 60 days to complete.  Lenovo dropped the ball.case# 4052K4Pcase# 405VRPcase 405LTRN
else	Customer service and better technical staff
else	The customer rep was very unprofessional. Not only she looked up the incorrect information, and I requested her to check again, she simply hung up in the chat session. I called in to the support line and talked to a customer rep who is very helpful.
else	Resolve ambiguity in return process... pdf with return label and condition form was sent. Unexpectedly a return box was sent with the same label and form.
else	By building better computers and replacement parts.
else	there was an issue with the replacement part being delivered to the wrong address, but this might have been the delivery company's fault
else	I dont know. The service guy had come 5 times already to fix the issue. But he failed even after persistent effort. My laptop is still unusable for last 5 months. Extremely unsatisfied. I dont see why I bought extended warranty from Lenovo.
else	better screen resolution;ution for my aging eyes like Apple's retina Display
else	Please provide engineer who is better technical experienced.
else	delayed parts and service. still not fixed? drive does not show in BIOS.
else	The first time, the customer rep said to keep the computer going because of a firmware update.  When that didn't work, I called back and was able to fix the issue.No complaints.
else	I originally opened this case on 05/02/18 (4065QSS)  never received a box. Another case was opened on  07/06/18 (406CF54)/ . this doesn't reference the Case number that you just sent me ? This has been an ongoing problem recently and I'm not sure why ? I want Parts replaced only and I get boxes, etc... Something has changed with service dramatically and not for the good ! I would appreciate a phone call to discuss please as this is getting frustrating since we have 300 Lenovo's ! Also there has been a recent change in the environmental policy which I didn't know about regarding AC Adapters, Line cords, DVD drives, and even batteries! I need to discuss with someone rather quickly to discuss this new policy.Regards, Algis Zyle - 216.256.9127 - zyle@cbhs.edu
else	Fix the item before returning it
else	Make installation instructions easier to find
else	There was no tracking at all after shipping off the laptop.
else	Standby the commitment from the technical teams. Managers hold to the promises made and act in a timelymanner
else	Ensure onsite technicians are knowledgeable of Lenovo products and show some care towards (from my POV) expensive equipment.
else	The replacement part we were send was a HDD and not an SSD. This obviously negatively impacts performance of the PC
else	improved in part availabity and shorten the time needed for part arrival
else	I was without a fully functioning laptop for over two months due in huge part to misinformation on how to get warranty repairs, and no phone number to call. And then my charger was not returned, which added another eight days.
else	The speakers stopped working for a few days but started working again a day before the technician came by. The technician checked my device carefully but could not detect any problems. I do not think that the service could have been better at this point, just that I am still confused as to why my technical problem ocured in the first place. I would have liked to have an explanation for the speakers to stop working.
else	When you have next business day support, make sure you communicate in a timely manner and have a mechanism where I can check updates without having to email/call someone.
else	you could fix all problem in one time and do dis faster
else	Speed up repair times.
else	Provide service promptly, do not stretch cases out for months, do not cancel cases without contacting me, do not enter false records in MTSA, do not add spurious addresses to my file, remove existing false addresses, provide printable labels instead of boxes to cut resolution time in half, support bulk CRU requests.
else	Send a more professional technician.
else	Please put me on your do not contact list.
else	Send the right parts.  Make sure on site engineers you are sending are better than our technical personnel.  We tried to replace 1 unit with defective motherboard and it only took us 20 minutes including testing.  Your engineers most often takes more than 1 hour to replace parts and test.  I should have choose rating below zero. The only problem of this laptop was that  it thus not turn on.  Upon replacing the motherboard,  later discovered that the keyboard is defective and the battery wont charge and unit has no sound both on speaker and headset even if we installed the latest driver as per end user( a manager) the only problem she encountered was that the unit wont turn on.Serial number of the unit wasn't registered on the Mboard since the service engineer did not bring the software to perform the operation.  Until now service engineer did not return to change the MBOARD settings with regards to the unit's serial number.   All of us in our team are very disappointed and I have recommend not to buy Lenovo products on our next or upcoming purchases.
else	last few times I don't get any emails so end up calling to see where we are at. Maybe something wrong with the website.
else	I didn't anticipate a choice for the return. I received the replacement within 7 days. Very prompt.
else	Fix problem and handle laptop appropriately so it is not returned with extra furdamage
else	Dont charge an arm and a leg for a peice of plastic. The price quoted for the plastic cover that has no electronics in it is almost the price of a new laptop. Compare this with my experience with Apple where they did a free replacement of iPad when I had a cracked glass.
else	address was incorrect on parts order - so took longer to get here
else	I am still waiting for my computer to be returned to me
else	my product was returned trashed. Customer service took no responsibility. needs to be honest and helpful not slow and evasive
else	Increase storage on idea pad so as to support windows 10 updates.
else	Tolld part wouldn't be in for month, then I asked for replacement of laptop, also taking long time for response
else	I had to wait for the warranty update which was my disappointment. Because of it, I had to come another day for service. Update of warranty should be done even before visiting service center if it's possible. Because, what if I don't have updated warranty and it's there last day of the warranty to get the service. That's not fair.
else	Taking To much time for resolution
else	Lenovo didn't call back with a solution as promised
else	Service Team is complete unprofessional and un-responsive. I had to wait for more than a week for the service which I was supposed receive within 48 hrs.
else	Fix my machine and do not send me surveys about telephone support I have not received.
else	Give updates
else	Actually respond to my request
else	Im still waiting for something to be mailed to me
else	A little miscommunication on return packaging- who's to provide it- myself, you, or the courier. Eventually the courier picked up the responsibilty, as I thought was there's antway. This only delayed the return by 1 day anyway. I was unaware of the progress in repairs to my laptop because, as I discovered on it's return, you had diligently updated me by e-mail. There lies the problem- my laptop, my only method of internet access, as my mobile phone is well out of date, was with yourselves being repaired. I could, therefore not read any of your messages. Texts would have been far more useful. Despite these relatively minor hiccups, I can find no fault with the Lenovo product, nor any of its staff. I would ave no hesitation recommending either to anyone. Thank you.
else	Faster shipping, faster repair.
else	Make better laptops and if a laptop does have issues have a more efficient system for repairing them and communicating to customers about the repairs.
else	Device returned to wrongnperson
else	"Have better quality control when returning merchandise. When I received my ""repaired"" laptop back I immediately noticed a light spot inside the screen, the system runs noticeably slower, and there is now a clicking sound any time the laptop is on. While my original issue was solved, I would not have sent it in for repair if I had known this would be the result."
else	Have spare parts on hand
else	Allow better control of return delivery. It's not possible to tell UPS you won't be in to receive the parcel if you know you'll be at work. Would be more efficient to either let people specify a date or have the option to be returned to a different address if the delivery will be made on a weekday (ie a work address).
else	The phone number had me going around in circles very difficult to get to where I wanted to go. Tablet not guaranteed for faults argos was going to exchange if I had a number given to me by Lenovo but they would only give one in first 30 days not 6 months. Beware of downloading updates
else	The stylus pen was not returned.
else	Kindly send the lenovo call close report
else	Waiting a week for parts
else	The only thing was that when I contacted support, they told me to ship the laptop and emailed me a shipping label.  I scrounged around, had some bubble wrap and felt confident in my packaging to securely send the laptop.  Then, had to drive 45 mins to my nearest fedex drop off spot.  The next day I received an empty box and a pick up label on my front step!!!  I was really surprised the support person did not tell me this was going to happen.  I could have save a lot of time and hassle had I have known that was coming.
else	I would consider the support better were it not left to me to track down progress, estimated completion date, etc. Plus your website was not functioning, so it required multiple calls to check on status and my timeline was particularly concerning because, as I explained in the initial conversation and throughout, I was in the U.S. temporarily, and it was urgent I receive the repaired laptop before leaving for overseas for the next year. the even greater concern is WHY the device DIED after only 1 1/2 years.
else	Actually have the Mgr call back and also fulfill the request on the product that's under warranty
else	Train your phone employees better.   I tried to order Windows 7 CDs for my laptop.  I was sent to a department where I had to order 5. Another person said it could not be done.
else	Clearer communication in regard to process of parts being delivered ex. Who will bring the part/parts, by shipment or a representative. Also, following through with phone communication.
else	Not have so many parts get put on backorder
else	Better service tracking
else	Fix the issue using the part I had paid for instead of sending the laptop back still broken
else	Send me updates and also send me my computer back
else	Problem not resolved as I have not heard an appropriate response back
else	The only thing that I'm not a fan of is how to enter a support call @ https://www.managedtechnicalsupportaccess.com/mtsarva/lenovo.html. The site is not the most user-friendly to create an issue. Once an issue is created, however, the service is fast and exceptional.
else	"I deeply believe if a product can last need to start from Sales.  Sales person need to know their product in and out and not just cheat users to buy and earn commission.  We were cheated to buy docking that not able to charge and sales team never mentioned at the 1st place.  Maybe when they quoted me the useless docking, they didn't even know the docking can't charge.the notebook at all. Now having problem and you know what they said? ""no return policy""!  BTW, they even try to bundle in the so call premium support in the equipment already come along with 3 years on site warranty in the quotation without even mentioned about the premium support until 2-3 mail of enquirers why the price was higher, only then letting us know.  That behavior is indeed no less than stealing. I put 2 points of satisfaction level is because the 2 points is for the technical customer support center.  Their are friendly and knowledgeable but unfortunately the satisfaction level was dragged down by the local Sales team; else it would have been 10.I don't just blamed local sales team as I have all the email support, please do approach me for detail if needed.  My email address is mchia@kcc.com."
else	Keep ticket updated online. I had to phone the desk on 5 occasions to find out the status of my ticket.
else	Not run out of engineers so there is a delay in the service and then not send the wrong part so it is delayed again
else	Make your idea pad with enough storage space to support windows updates
else	While it did take only one day to resolve the issue, it still took way too long -- was on phone w rep for about an hour maybe -- to resolve thiis issue, which was not a major one. BUT... prior to even calling a rep, was on your website for TWO hours trying to troubleshoot on my own. Also, did not appareciate that the phone number for help with a real person was burried within site and very hard to locate!
else	Send all the parts in one go
else	The software update is not good at all. It seems that the software is having some bugs & is not genuine. Also the performance has been reduced.
else	Make the phone line clearer as I found it difficult to hear and the accents were very pronounced.
else	My mobile having hardware problem in vibration and they simply update the software. Still I am suffering from same problem.
else	If the customer is not aware of technical stuff. Please do not drag them to do. It would be really good if you could arrange a service person to visit and check the machine.
else	My wife and I both had the Moto G4.  After running an update they both stopped working.  Hers was under warranty and Motorola did a great job replacing it.  Mine unfortunately was not under warranty, so there was nothing that could be done.
else	Prefer technician to come to resolve the issue rather than trying many errors myself
else	I had to enter this request 3 separate times in order to complete the request. The first request was completed days after I received my faulty new laptop. This request was cancelled without notification, as was the next request (which was submitted weeks later when I called to inquire about my request status). The third attempt happened to be just outside of the 1 month warranty replacement policy, meaning I had to send my laptop in for repairs, even though I had actually submitted 2 previous requests well within the 1 month warranty. This was extremely frustrating. It seems very logical that I should be notified when my request is cancelled... Why is this not the case? My laptop was useless, and this prolonged the time I had no laptop to use.
else	Answering calls more quickly
else	Send the parts to the on site support person faster. It took almost one month.
else	Make initial contact with the service tack easier
else	Keep clients update with news even after public holidays
else	Improve wait time.
else	why did it take so long  and take so many phone calls to get a date when the engineer could come. Reported on 22nd Dec , called on the 4th Jan , 8th Jan , 10th Jan and 11th Jan wasting hours as it was always on hold.
else	"allow a bigger ""return"" period around Christmas time. I originally bought this in early november as a christmas present for my mother, when she opened it on christmas it wasn't working correctly. Lenovo didn't allow me to return the item as it was over 14 days, they should allow a bigger return period around christmas time; I was essentially being punished for being organised."
else	They sent my finished product to a different address from my return address and never apologized for the inconvenience I had to go through.
else	I never got a response from technician.
else	A replacement should have been sent when parts were so late being received and wrong part was sent.
else	understand the issue before sending parts
else	Get the parts right the first time. We will be contacting your account rep.
else	be more proactive in the urgency to turn around a unit to the customer
else	They sent me the wrong part, and said I would not be able to return it for a different one.
else	Support being out of country are sometimes hard to understand,  yet are nice and try to be helpful..  Communicationwith repair facility is very poor.  So called case manager doesn't respond at all. Should be a supervisor I can talk towhen needed. Should be a way for customer to contact repair facility in Tenn. directly for updates.
else	Resolve my issue the first time, not tell me I can go places for warranty service I can't, and not forget to include my power cord when returning my device.
else	The packing job for returning my computer was unsatisfactory.
else	Not ask customer to do technical work
else	Still waiting for an update.
else	To be able to fix a problem straight away instead of coming 4 times. Also replacing parts with reconditioned parts.
else	Have more experienced telephone supports techs. I had to ask 3 times to get him to let me talk to a manager, because he was not resolving my problem.
else	Work not completed on Time still the phone is with you people why the hell are you all even asking for feedback
else	The wrong part was shipped the first time.
else	We sent away this customer's laptop and it was returned with no fault found. issue is now worse than when it was sent away.
else	Improved resolution time of the replacement part
else	Laptop did not function properly when returned. Sent back for a third time
else	Provide better step-by-step progress, tracking information.
else	Support technicians need the ability to actually talk directly to customers if online support doesn't work.  Some people don't have the technical know how or expertise to carry out some of the necessary steps in order to resolve their problem.  If technician/support person can talk directly to them on phone would ease customer stress & help to resolve issues faster & easier.   Also support personnel need to really listen or ensure they understand exactly what the customer requires.
else	Have the newly manufactured item tested before shipping out to client's place, so that client won't experience part failures upon receiving it.
else	improve screen resolution quality
else	The process to get a serviceable phone was ridiculous, and I did not receive a charger with the new model that was sent. The old charger is not addequate.
else	greater communication around return times
else	"I purchased a new Lenovo laptop. I called to get assistance with disabling the ""tap to click"" function on my mouse. It took a few calls, talking to various people and being on hold, etc., only to finally have someone tell me it can't be turned off."
else	1. Provide contact number so that customer can speak and COMMUNICATE2. RESPOND (We don't need automated mails3. Be RESPONSIBLE4. Fix time-frame of 5 days to resolve issues. Lead time of 30-45 days to get part for a laptop is UNACCEPTABLE and UNBELIEVABLE in today's scenario
else	Update drivers on the Lenovo webpage after major Windows updates.
else	Better follow up, accurate follow up, was told a main board needed to be replaced, second rep via phone who helped me said saw nothing of it, received back over 1 month later, indicated HDD replaced, one rep was very rude, one was great and actually got the ball moving, wish i could remember his name because he should be in charge.  I WILL NEVER PURCHACE ANOTHER PRODUCT FROM LENOVO, WORSE EXPERIENCE EVER!!!
else	faster server with online repair status in which I can contact the technician direct with any questions.
else	The rep on the phone didn't even update my name, so I becomes John...
else	The laptop which i brought itself worst product, always something happen, this time they returned quickly but pervious time they took so many days to return it..  Please advise them to return it quickly..  Thanks..
else	Accurate information about where parts will be delivered and when. I for a different answer every time. The last time, the person read the same script to me 3 times.
else	It's now too late for Lenovo to improve my experience as I've contacted a consumer rights company and returned the device to the retailer where it was purchased.
else	No one responded to my support request and I couldn't get through to other means of requesting support such as the online chat.
else	Beings this is the 4th warranty replacement phone I have received and the representatives have only been able to find one claim is very frustrating. To me it is obvious that representatives are not properly biting accounts or not properly in putting customer information. Hopefully this phone will not do the same thing the other 3 have done. Would have really appreciated at least getting the 2nd generation of the Moto z force for all the Hassel I have had with Motorola and their products. Its seems as if there is a software issue with the 1st generation Moto z force. And from doing hours of research, I have gathered I am not the only one that has had this issue with this phone. I have the 2nd generation as well and seem to not have nearly the amount of problems I have had with the 1st generation. When is enough enough with the problem phones i have received from you guys?! BEYOND dissatisfied with Motorola products and customer service.
else	Less background noise. Hard to hear the operator
else	Not have a part go on back order, then tell me that if you are to escalate the issue that it will add 72 hours to the time frame. I found that ridiculous especially since every product we purchase has the on site warranty repair
else	improve in engineer response from technical call center
else	Making touchpad error proof from bad update
else	"This was the second time I had to send in a new computer (purchased in June 2017) for repair in less than 9 months -- for the same ""no power on' issue."
else	Faster response, accurate status, first time fix, email when parts hold, email prepaid label instead of waiting on box
else	just waiting time.
else	faster return date, read message on paper about fixing fps drops
else	Phone replacement went as planned.I was told due to the fact the charge port on the phone and the cord melted I would receive a new cord. Charge cord was never received
else	listen to the customer and speed up this feedback process that takes over 2 weeks.
else	improve resolution speed
else	repair product faster
else	I was told that replacements for my Moto X were out of stock and was offered a Moto Z Play 32GB instead.I accepted that offer and immediately purchased some Mods for the expected Moto Z from a local source.Later I received a call from customer support saying that they were not going to honor the offer of the Moto Z as a replacement.This is 100% unethical and extremely bad business.  I have purchased multiple Motorola devices in the past.  This poor customer service experience, which ended up with me being stuck with mods that I can not use, will cause me to reevaluate my relationship with Motorola in the future.I believe that I am owed some form of recompense because I was made a promise that was later rescinded.Is there anything that you can offer to make this right?
else	sent wrong part 1st time
else	While I'm disappointed that I was unable to receive a CDMA/GSM unlocked phone as a replacement for my Moto X Pure, I am quite satisfied with the substitution of the Moto Z Play.  However, because the phone is GSM only, I did have to switch my carrier, which brings some uncertainty as I get to know the new carrier.
else	Too many questions to return my phone and the one i got its not working properly.  Not happy.
else	Improve on the resolution time.Lenovo advisory advises to immediately power off the equipment due to risk of fire but the support took 3 weeks to come onsite verify & rectify the risk.
else	sometimes the SP service can be too long because they are waiting on a part from Lenovo.
else	My screen was damaged when I received my laptop. Why wont you answer the phone. Please contact me.
else	Quicker response, its taken 3 weeks to finally arrange a pickup for the laptop Im returning
Agent	Support agents NEED to be trained better to resolve issues. They also need to be aware issues reported are numerous, and have studied their own sites for similar complaints!
else	Make sure field techs have updated training.  Tech was not aware that T480s keyboard replacement does not require removing the case.  Was also not aware of the USB Type C charging.
else	The service from the time I mailed the phone until received was superior, however the phone customer service was a frustrating experience because each agent handled situation differently
else	I never spoke with a person on the phone. I was not able to get someone to call me back.
else	The computer will not boot after being returned from service center
else	Better technical support response
else	It started when I spoke to the service lady on the phone, she sold me shipping for my computer for $15, and once I paid it online, she then rescinded the offer and told me I would get a refund (for which I have not received yet). She also told me that the described problem with my computer was a known hardware problem, for which I was never notified of and should not have had to pay to send it to be serviced. There was next to no communication once I sent off my computer to the depot. There were only emails that indicated that the computer was recieved and then the repair completed. There was no indication that my computer was being shipped back. When I did recieve it, the delivery company that was used, left the box in plain sight on my door step when no one was home. I spent  $60 to send you my computer, that is under a year old, to your company. I felt tracking was important, because I spent a significant amount on the computer from costco ($1000 with extended warranty). Who knows how long it was sitting out there for. Unimpressed. I feel completely dissatisfied with the customer service I have received from your company, and will never purchase your product again.
else	"I got an email saying a part was coming, but no phone call. That may not have been your fault since my own company's IT people originally sent you the referral I needed help. It ended up taking over a week for the part to actually arrive, which mean all that time I was using a computer that had a screen that had ""double vision"" and incorrect color so it was extremely difficult to get any computer work done. The computer repair man set up an appointment ahead of time, which was great. Then the day of he called to say he would be there in 30 minutes. An hour later he called to say the part that was sent was wrong and he had to reschedule for the next day. All of that was very frustrating. However, when he learned my location was going to be different he offered to pick up the part where it was delivered to and meet me at my other location, which was really helpful. The repair itself only took half and hour so it didn't take up too much of my work time waiting for it to be done. The repair people were polite and professional."
else	Go out of business and never burden another IT department with your sub-par products.
else	Pretest parts.  The first replacement main board was defective.
else	Dispatch parts a faster.
else	Make a tracking system
else	First of all if a customer is facing issue your duty is to correct it.but not to give excuses as they always give me to me  and if you are not able to find the solution replace that particular part that is creating problem to the customer rather than tellimg him to try for at least one more time
else	third party vendor dragging issue without resolving it.
else	not meeting the SLA that purchase on the system, part delayed and nobody is following up to inform. Main issue the service SLA always not meet.
else	Spare parts quality is not good
else	Provide updates to customers regardless of what is happening behind the sceens. I received no update in nearly two weeks and I had to call in multiple times to get no answers. Unacceptable CS.
else	provide a faster service, have telephone staff that you can actually understand, provide email updates, provide swifter updates - we never have had issues with Dell warranty support, Lenovo support has always been poor
else	I am so frustrated ... after nearly 7 weeks and very little communication I received my computer back.  The main repairs were made but a FRENCH keyboard was put on my machine as a replacement for the English.  When I immediately called all I received is the run around.  I still need to follow up and get it fixed but I have not been given any assurance that it would not again take a very long time.  It seems that someone could hold the keyboard to fix this mistake.  Mistakes happen but ownership of the error and a plan to fix it would go a long way.  Please call me if you need to discuss 919 632 7705.  BTW - the call center is not to blame it is the policy.
else	The wrong part was delivered twice
else	Decrease the amount of waiting time for business users and improve the quality of agents knowledge
else	Ease of contacting the technical staff and faster resolve of issues.
else	Correct sending out incorrect emails regarding status of parts
else	Lenovo can follow the correct procedure and deliver a latop with the image/build for our operating environment. We received a laptop we cannot use and I had to speak with contract management and Lenovo again to advise them they need to arrange with SXIQ for a built laptop to be sent to us that we can use. In talking with the representative responsible for the resolution of this issue he mentioned I would have sent it away to SXIQ for the build. To which I advised lenovo didnt follow the correct procedure and they are responsible to arrange such things. Further unnecessary delays imposed which is unacceptable.
else	Representative entered wrong IMEI number which caused a huge delay and the result in tao different payments inwhich i have not received a refunded payment for yet.
else	I wish Lenovo will provide the Tech will all the parts needed for the install to prevent the tech from coming out for a second trip.
else	I have issues with the phone from the begging and had to call about 6-7 times to fix a problem I did not cause. Because your company messed up my phone has a dead pixel and now is not under warranty.
else	better visibility to part availability; also part stock at Seattle DC
else	Onsite had part then opened and it was broke.  Then set to repair center they claimed I broke the computer and would not fix. Had to explain that it was the onsite repair guy who tampered with the computer. Finally being sent back. Next time I will not fool with onsite
else	Customer service took long time to get back. USB recovery media for multiple machines not provided
else	The operator misspelled my e-mail address and when I rang up to see why I hadn't received an e-mail as expected the 2nd operator assumed he knew what I needed but sent me the wrong information which meant I had to ring a 3rd time.
else	Increase field technicians to speed up resolution of the cases.
else	It took too many steps in too many departments to get my warranty information updated.  Its been almost 2 months and the computer still doesnt work.
else	Not everyone owns a printer so could you send a label to return & if you have 1 computer how do you print it anyway?
else	Cut down on times to accomplish repair
else	More communication between all parties: support, shipping agent, technical support and customer.
else	Please send the part.
else	1. Let me know you are actually attending the building before showing up.2. Make sure the parts you are bringing actually work.
else	Figure out the problem before throwing (wrong) parts at it.
else	Ensure the warranty on site service on timely manner.
else	Constant updates
else	provide the service on time and in a convenient way.
else	do more careful diagnosis, we sent it back for three times but the laptop was still not fixed. Finally, it was fixed by replacing the motherboard. The quality of thinkpad is questionable and unsatisfied. The motherboard went wrong within 3 month of purchase.
else	Computer was returned in worse condition than it was sent for service jn
else	Improve the technical service. sending 2 times the same wrong parts when they got all the information i could provide is a waste of time
else	Depot service was too slow with a parts hold, took over a month and was not repaired in a timely manner. Can be improved by sending customer the replacement part quickly, or replacement machine which I have accepted after multiple attempts of case escalation.
else	reduction in issue logging until issue resolution
else	early response
else	real time updates send via email or text messages
else	Provide better and clearer instructions for removing the cover in order to replace the hard drive.
else	Shipped defective and received the replacement 2 days later!!  AWESOME!
else	If the computer is waiting for parts, then it should be listed on the web site. There was no information listed once the system had arrived at the repair site.
else	Lenovo should update the status from time to time.  Issue was reported May 2 and until now not yet resolved.
else	No return phone calls or promised follow up calls.   Customer support well below par
else	Wrong part was received and had to be re-ordered. I had to chase with the end user to verify that an engineer had attended and completed the service as the service request was closed early and incorrectly
else	Clearer tracking of when its being worked on ect. Online monitoring did not work
else	Faster resolution and time reduce
else	Faster spare part replacement
else	Getting computer parts shipped faster, offering to send in the computer for better service.
else	Lenovo can provide an exact fix, rather than a guess reboot of my laptop that failed and I lost valuable costly software because of this. The issue was my laptop mouse pad stopped working after windows update, never buy Lenovo again!  Never had this issue with HP or ASUS. If I don't get this fixed I will do reviews on the Internet of my experience with Lenovo and advise family and friends.
else	They should collect and return the laptop. The service centres are so far away. Ot at the very least you should have a service centre in the north.After servicing i realize my battery life is very very poor. I want to send it for servicing again but i have not does so only because of the distance and lack of time.
else	Speed of service, knowledge of staff
else	Resolve the issue of waiting on parts to be shipped and then receiving the wrong parts.
else	Suggested solution was not successfull and now I am still waiting for a part
else	Accept responsibility when an item is damaged and returned with a new fault
else	update warranty info with retailers as warranty on website was not matching the service date
else	Parts on backorder has become pattern and next day on site service is not on time.
else	Very poor technical understanding of problem. System was given to them twice but failed to resolve the problem.
else	Dont send already dead parts. Dont blame me for your technical errors at your customer service.  Correct your database errors.
else	The first part that was delivered was defective.  The replacement part was ordered and delivered next day which was awesome.  Mike was awesome and we appreciated his excellent and professional service.
else	Improve the knowledge of your service engineers
else	Immediate Service - received a new phone the very next day (morning).  Totally no hassel
Agent	stop selling products or define the products  as trash  for E series  laptops as your technical service agents says this is a entry laptop and will have lag problems
else	faster support i was having a dell and i had a more complex issue, nevertheless, it was fixed in 24 h
else	Better e-mail updates on statuses of tickets.
else	Explain a little clearer the return process. I had less than 24 hours to arrange suitable packaging before UPS called!
else	more information on the https://www.managedtechnicalsupportaccess.com/dashboard Information about where the call is in the process and information about eta's
else	If you can reduce the waiting time, regarding the availability of products or spare parts etc.
else	Less procedures,  faster response Not over the roof price.Cable on Ebay was $8 your price $55It took many emails and forms as if I'm buying a car on lease
else	It took a long time to get the part in.
else	In my initial call for service I was told I would be sent a replacement phone and I should use the packaging from that phone to return the defective phone.  After waiting two weeks with no new phone I called again and was told I needed to return my phone first and a replacement would then be sent.  This caused a long delay without a phone.
else	Reduce response time on email
else	My old phone was defective and under warranty and I received a new phone promptly as a replacement.
else	Reduce the waiting time for parts and engineer to arrive. 6 weeks to fix a hard drive and motherboard issue for a laptop on next day onsite business warranty is rubbish.
else	Reducing waiting times between first report of defect and shipping back from the repair center
else	Don't make me wait an entire month to get it back because of a part. I was told 9 days, then 9 business days and those are two very different things. Then it was we don't know how long. That is never an okay answer. You need to know how long it should take. And it if takes a month for the repair, send the customer a new unit and sell the old one as a refurbish.
else	The previous low mark on ease of installation was due to receiving no instructions or link to get online instructions.
else	A little more clarification as to what part was being sent out.  CRU(Customer Replaceable Unit) is a bit vague, but I am happy that it was fixed and very fast.
else	Improve service centre response time and be reasonable with cost assessments. It makes no sense to get repairs done at Lenovo unless covered by warrenty and if you are in no rush to get your laptop back
else	Collection of the failed unit was difficult due to miscommunication of the address which took a long time to resolve.  Once that was sorted service was very good
else	Send the correct parts and they should be working
else	The customer service rep told me I had no warranty on the first phone call, despite my telling them there was no damage to the casing of the machine--the screw was simply out, and the slot was stripped. I had to make a 2nd call to push for service. Then the ticket online did not get updated past the receipt of my machine. Suddenly one day I go out to the car and the $800.00 laptop is lying on the step near the door. I work from home and have dogs. The door did NOT get knocked on.
else	Ensure the engineer is provided all the necessary parts for the onsite repair, so that does not need to come out a second time. Ensure that if a second onsite visit is required that the parts are expedited and it doesnt take a full week to get back out to customer.
else	I received the product back exactly as I sent it to you, not working.  Had to send it in again and am still waiting for it.
else	Lenovo should include the tracking number for devices in the email that they send to inform customers of when their devices are shipped back to them.
else	Decrease the turnaround time for resolution, and give more visibility into what is going on. The online tools for tracking service status work well, but are not updated often enough.
else	Your employees are a bit unprofessional...they joke and laugh in front of the coustomer. I think this does not looks good for an international company
Agent	Im so disappointed how the agent name Krisna evaluated my service request 8010620630 with just a screenshot, with this case Im started to doubt my loyalty with lenovo thinkpad products.
else	Do not receive any notification. Please call or send an email to me. Thank you.
else	Wrong part originally ordered
else	Even after system update have been done in Hubli Motorola service center on 09/02/18, the problem what I am facing with camaraderie not resolved. Unnecessary I have wasted my time and money.If possible please call your service center and give instructions how to repair the mobile camaraderie.When I have to visit your service center in Hubli?ThanksJayant Patil09902475249jayantsp99@gmail.com
else	Long lasting problem resolution and replacement of the faulty phone.
else	contact me or advise me of any delays or issue with part deployment
else	wrong problem on ticket, wrong part, now have bitlocker code to enter in addition to original problem
else	IVR is too long to connect Lenovo Support agent and Executive should have more Technical knowledge to troubleshoot issue
else	wrong pc info was not correct, so the wrong part was shipped, this was a Rogers error.
else	Allow me to install my own parts since I have A+
else	The 3G Telstra card was not returned with the PC. However service was great!! Where is the card?
else	More updates would be appreciated
else	first week waiting for  box and free shipping label. user can do himself to get online print of  shipping label then packed the laptop to send Lenovo service center soon without waiting a week
else	Just stop bothering me over phone and email to take this survey.
else	I submitted the paperwork that was request4d but received an email saying the case was closed because paperwork was not submitted.  I had to call and go over all information again with a new person.
else	With our IT department to rebuild image
else	get to the phone somewhat faster
else	Did not work after Android nougat update.
else	"Your technical support is dysfunctional. The first contact instructed me to perform a redundant test and closed my original case overnight. The next person constantly needed to leave me on hold to get information. That person had a HDD shipped here next day. That same afternoon I received an email apologizing for not having any inventory explaining a drive would be shipped once one is found. I called to inform ""support"" that I had the new drive in fromt of me. So they scheduled a tech. Four days in a row no tech called or showed up. I finally just asked if I could install the drive myself. Phone support offered access to a factory reset download and I asked if it would be a more current version of Windows 10 than my recovery drive made when the pc was new. I assumed their offer afterwards meant that it was. It turns out it is the same version 1607 that I had already. This was as dysfuctional an experience as a person could have had."
else	"Well the first guy came installed the new hard drive and the OS would not install, so he said it was the flash drive Lenovo sent was defective, so he said he has another one coming and when it shows that it would be easy to install myself. My question to him was what if it still wont work, he said then it needs a motherboard.  I think it would be easier if you ""the Guy"" take the computer back with you because that way if it don't work you can fix it the right way and just bring it back, instead of me trying and it still not working, I then have to call again and wait again and this is the computer that runs my salvage yard. Anyhow he said he could not take it with him, so I waited  for another few days for the new thumb drive, which still did not work, I then had to call you guys again and wait another few days for you to send another guy "" who was awesome "" by the way, and it was not the mother board what ever he did it worked..."
else	Your online service update feature did not work. There was no update on the status of the repairs for about 8 days. Please let me know why the keyboard did not work, other than you seemed to have replaced the board containing the keys.
else	We received an email from Lenovo that our laptop had not been received after we received an email that it had been received. That's just confusing and wrong.Besides that, it would have been nice if they had explained what they found wrong with the laptop, why it had malfunctioned, and how they had fixed it.
else	send the right part
else	Less noise static on your end so can hear better the one time I called was kids or adults making noise so had hard time hearing
else	Little communication from service department. Call was cut off and not call quality poor. Very hard to understand call handler.
else	Better communication about case updates via email
else	Provide updates to the customer. I found that I had to constantly chase up Lenovo, and they were not updating the case, with the correct notes, even after advising them numerous times, to update the contact details.
else	Engineer should be more professional, confirm the model of motherboard before proceed replacement. Now my main battery wont work. I called the technical support the engineer said my main battery has no issue, it is the issue from the engineer replace the not compatible for my current model. I'm so disappointed for the lenovo center's engineer.
else	unable to contact anyone
else	My computer was returned with a chip cracked out of he casing. The touchscreen doesnt work as it did. The colors change while streaming and the computer is much slower than before I sent it in.
else	Please have more professional staff to inform customer upon the delay
else	The rep did not fix the problem that I spent 40 minutes on the phone describing. It appeared he did not understand my question and he chose a simple resonse and fix and really had no way of knowing it was resolved. I still have a problem if indeed it is a proble
else	The phone voice is very blurry. The technician and I were having a hard time to hear each other clearly.
else	We had to call several times for on site repairs this is waste of time.
else	After providing the damage parts Screenshot & Clip on chat then also the team asking to send it again on mail.I think its should be done on one attempt on chat or on mail.
else	More feedback,  quicker solving
else	Perhaps have parts on hand so the wait isn't stretched out to 3 weeks.
else	Lenovo did not reach out to me about my part or service date. And I had to follow up multiple times for 2 weeks.. We have next day support and this was absolutely unacceptable.
else	Shorten the response time or delivery of parts to meet the expectations.
else	Once I shipped the machine and you guys received it, you emailed me for more info which I was cool with and responded. But then you ghosted me for 2 weeks with no updates, when I called no one had any idea what was going on with my machine. After maybe the 10th call someone finally realized my machine was on hold due to insufficient info. Nobody had contacted me about that, past the initial email which I RESPONDED to. Overall terrible experience.
else	Send instructions
else	The fix that your tech representative did for me wasn't a permanent fix, she just flipped a switch in control panel. I have had the issue again and it has caused me to restart, taking time out of the limites time I have for my activities.
else	Keep more parts in stock so they are not on backorder as much.
else	My laptop has been returned, however keeps freezing, screen goes black and my audio is not working
else	Implement a faster service (including shipping and attention) your representatives have no idea on whats going on in another department regarding the issue
Agent	train agents to speak more clearly and slowly. I was initially unable to understand some of the statements, however after repeating was able to comprehend.
else	They came to replace motherboard. The guy did not know how to feed the new motherboard's serial number to the system. Still pending. The onsite-technician used a 3rd party remote accessing software (I don't remember the software's name, anyways not through Lenovo website) and infected my brand new laptop with viruses.
else	difficulty getting replacement parts in general for pcs and monitors
else	Send updatea in english with accurate info
else	Execution time frame could be improved.
else	Regular updates and on site servicing
else	improve replacement part quality
else	You have a update that breaks your finger print scanner. What I contacted your tech support I was told I can wipe my hard drive and BLOCK the new driver that's pushed to my laptop. For one of the premier laptops I am rather surprised this is my only option.
else	Make your service faster and accurate and check your replacing part before sending to customers .
else	Incorrect part ordered on the initial ticket.
else	I called the technical centre three times, the first two people did not provide any useful help and one said I could not get my laptop repaired, another said she did not deal with my case so she was not sure. It was Mr Ivan Ivanov who helped me a lot. He was quite patient and finally I got my issue solved. So I think Lenovo could further improve the telephone service.
else	Proper checking and installing the parts which are not already used and proper battery for laptop
else	Be faster on deciding to send the case and make me sending my machine back to repair. You spend almost two weeks to decide to send me the case, before that you are just trying to let me fix it by myself. But in fact it is totally helpless. Also, please send more tech people online so that we can contact you more efficiently. I waited for almost an hour to get someone online without fixing any problem.
else	You failed to keep me updated throughout the process.I had to reach out myself over five times - three of which were just to confirm you actually received the device.Finally, you told me explicitly the issue was confirmed and repaired with a system board replacement over the phone and when I received the device back, the original isssue is still present. The device seems as though no one even worked on it.
else	Send a return package with the courier,  full function test on the device before you return it.  As it is still faulty.
else	How about just following up and following through with the service you've promised.  I responded to a recall issue on a Thinkpad.  I've made about 6 phone calls to customer service.  I'm usually told that a service rep will come out to resolve the problem.  In fact we've never received a visit or even a phone call to schedule.  Each time I've called back I'm promised the same, but again nothing has happened except that my cases have been automatically closed with absolutely no resolution.
else	Filed service rep had to make second appointment as he was initially sent the wrong part.
else	Be on time for scheduled appointment
else	better updates
else	The issue has not been resolved, even after 3 phone calls to your company and after returning the computer twice.  We will be contacting your company again because the issue has not been resolved.
else	This rating was given because my customer was very upset that it took over 2 weeks to get a replacement laptop because there were no parts available.   When I worked with the IBM repair personnel we determined which components may be causing the display of the laptop to freeze the computer and the screen to a gray/black screen.  They client had a NBD on site Accidental warranty.   I was notified by email that it would from the first week of September to October to November for the parts to repair the laptop.  The client is a dental office, he takes his laptop home to remote into the office for emergency calls for his patients, do have his wife do bookkeeping and to call patients to remind them of an appointment the next day.   He was without these tasks for 2 weeks, I was able to get a loaner after the first week.  I personally have at least 10-12 hours working with my client, Lenovo for a repair option, creating a backup, deleting his personal information and cleaning up the laptop of files.   This was all at my time and expense to keep a customer somewhat happy.   The IBM and Lenovo personnel I worked with were excellent, IBM hands were tied because there parts were not available to repair the unit the Next Business Day and were not going to be available from Lenovo from the email and phone calls that they would be in by October and the rest by November.  I finally received a replacement laptop for the doctor, which I then had to setup and restore for his use.
Agent	Maybe it was that only agent I spoke to that evening, perhaps better train your night crew.
else	Don't go for this type of model, it has manufacturing defect in lid, lid case gets broken frequently due to hard hinges. Lenovo should not sell this product to the customer after this knowledge.
else	I don't remember what the call was about.
else	Time to send technical person was much delayed
else	I was expected to return the defective phone before you would ship the new one or pay $40 and you would ship the new one. None of this was my fault and this was unacceptable. It was worked out after talking to a manager. But your process was ridiculous. How is someone supposed to get their info off the old phone if expected to return it before receiving the new one?
else	There is a lot of background noise during the call & it was difficult to hear the service representative
else	Faster resolution.  Took multiple calls
else	The technician need to be more professional
else	It looks as the phone I got is new or at least it came with everything.  I thought I was going to get a phone without the back part and the battery.  The only thing i didn't like was the waiting time for me to receive it.
else	As far as I know, we are paying for next day service. We are not seeing parts or a tech on-site for two to three weeks lately. The tech who arrived did a great job, fast and professional. The arrival times have been terrible for some time now.
else	Be faster, offer more clear and timely updates. Make sure packages go to the right address.
else	"Better customer service representatives on the phone, the person I spoke to was very hard to understand, unprofessional and made the overall experience unpleasant and stressful. Also emails sent to update me on the progress of my laptop repair were blank of all information including my name, service order number, order status and any tracking information. When I would click the ""View Update Online"" link to check the progress of my claim it would return a message saying there was no such claim in my name. When I agreed to have the laptop sent away for repair the customer service representative did not reply any information about the courier company and only gave me an extremely vague answer as to when the courier would be picking up my laptop meaning I have to take an entire day off work to wait around for the courier. The laptop has now been returned and so far has not shown the same problem again. However the laptop is now extremely slow in booting up and opening up any programs I wish to use (such as word or documents). Also every time I turn on the laptop it shows a message that it needs to update and then proceeds to do so for 10 minutes before I can log in and use the computer. This is extremely frustrating as I need my laptop for work and the time it takes to boot up and open programs is very taxing on my time and limits my ability to work effectively. The laptop also constantly shows a dialogue box saying my harddrive settings have change and the computer needs to be rebooted for them to take affect, even after I have rebooted the computer 3 times in a row. The computer also constantly opens a windows 10 dialogue box saying that I need the latest version of windows 10 on my computer, even after I have updated it twice to the latest version."
else	PRINT your US service support telephone number on your warranty cards and your WEBSITE!
else	initial date of calling Lenovo service department was December 27 2018. spent countless hours on the phone trying to get a box with paid shipping. waited for box did not receive the box. Tried again still no box talked to manager after two months of waiting for laptop got laptop on February 7th. will never purchase another Lenovo product.. train support staff how to service your customers in a timely manner. this could not have been your first service call.
else	Communicate on back ordered part better
else	My computer never worked right out of the box, your support team couldnt fix it over the phone and neither could the store. I returned it for a Dell which has been great. They couldnt get my cursor to work?
else	Have better support team in place before putting product on market.The feasco with your so called tablet cost me 20. The price of a extended memory .l was on the phone talking to your support team for nearly 2hours
else	Better updates, abs more empathy for the customer's situation. That is, if your update days the repair will not be fine for 2 months, please recognize that I need you to just send me a replacement machine. I can't be without my device for that long!!!
else	There was never any information telling me when to expect UPS collection outward (and the tracking number does give access to that information on the UPS website), and nothing to tell me when it was likely to arrive back - it just 'arrived'.
else	"The ""Call Back"" feature was not working so I had to dial the help number and wait about 7 minutes for an answer"
else	Have parts in stock and have quicker onsite replacement
else	More customer service reps, I waited on the phone a very long time.
else	Make sure parts are shipped to repairers promptly and ensure authorised repairers are paying attention to detail when fitting parts. I did not buy a top of the line X1 Carbon to have parts slapped into it.
else	more visibility of the status of the support (when parts are shipped, technician en route, etc) and emailed or text message alerts
else	Better status update up website, it's not being updated frequently, and most of the time it's out of dated. Also when doing the LED replacement, they broke my webcam, had to send in the 2nd time to fix it. Also a shipping box should be provided for customer to ship the laptop back for repair, the first repair rep told me Lenovo does not provide box, I had to use my own box. But 2nd rep offered me a box. It should be provided!! Especially if it's a warranty repair.
else	We have not received the computer back despite an email from you saying it has been delivered.
else	Speed up the response time
else	Better communication on return status. I got email after product was returned
else	Initial call was logged & the follow up email with the shipping info etc, was not received. I emailed but no response then I had to make several calls to resolve the issue. Apparently the reason was your systems were unable to cater for the address length (exceeded maximum length), once this was resolved things ran reasonably smoothly
else	Acknowledge that the 4K display on the 15 inch 720 is defective and do a recall
else	don't outsource phone technical support
else	Tech came out and had difficulty replacing the screen on my laptop.  He had to order new parts to replace more of the screen and top to the laptop because he could not remove the screen from the top
else	Just send the right replacement part to the service person.
else	Make sure all parts are being delivered to your tech so there a not multiple service calls.
else	Although, I m using lenovo products from the last 5-6 years even I have more then 4-5 Commercial series in my office but very bad experience i faced this time.I suggest -Change your third party support engineers ASAP.  They don't have any hardware knowledge and don't cooperate with us at the board replacing time. please call back on my hand phone 09999686562 for more clarifications.
else	Provide a technician or instructions on how to replace the drive without losing data.  I requested this on a follow up email but received no response.
else	lower wait times
else	Provide No update for improve performance.and
else	Contacting you was a nightmare and once initial contact was made, and initial resolution failed, it was then also very difficult to provide an update or change shipping arrangement that was subsequently instigated without consultation as to my availability to be in the office to meet the courier.
else	Make sure the part is in stock, so it can be delivered to the repair facility promptly. (The delay was to receive a part from Lenovo)
else	be more transparent with warranty offerings so that you do not deceive your customers.invest and broaden your customer support base with more technicians, so that repair times actually correspond to warranty's promises.when a problem is recurring, like my keyboard breaking 2 times, the same way, take in consideration that maybe the production patch is problematic and DO something about it! and don't forget. this time, u just shipped me a part. I FIXED IT MYSELF!
else	Improve on the technical efficacy
else	We really felt like we got the run around when it came to repairing our 6 week old computer.  We were upset and frustrated that only because we continued to call and complain was the new part suddenly made available.  The company should stand by its products, but have repair parts available in a timely fashion to all customers, not just the ones that complain the most!
else	better training your technical staffs
else	Wider range of on hand replacement parts.
else	Provide regular updates to the consumer, rather than have the consumer having to call to find out. There seems to be disconnect on the progress updates.At the point of collection, there should be a slip of paper acknowledging all the work that was done. No such slip was issued to me
else	Just improve the website for logging calls, every other aspect of your service is exemplary but the managedtechnicalsupportaccess.com is inferior to the old website in every way.
else	Sir, I am given the mobile on 23-Jul-2018 but still now 10-Aug-2018 I am not received my mobile. It's still under service for 18days.
else	Not at all just have cheaper parts for out of warranty
else	"Actually give me updates. The laptop was there for close to a month and when I talked to someone for an update, the repair was taken off hold for a ""part"" and when I asked why I was not given a status I was ignored and disconnected."
else	we are working in a 24*7 environment delay in receiving part effects productivity of end user. so one thing you need to improve is that time consuming in parts delivery.
else	First resolve this issue then i can give feedback for you
else	Inspect the problem by attending physically
else	I was never updated. site never update. I had to call several times. noone ever had answers
else	provide driver for windows 10 update
else	Need to improve vendor level support also while call logging so many proofs, videos and all are asking your technical team
else	Address the issue reported and return the laptop in the same or better condition than it was sent in. Or send out the replacement part if user replaceable like Dell or HP can do.
else	I could have received better help from the first tech support person I spoke to on the phone. There was a simple mechanical switch at the top of the screen that can cover the camera lens. I hadn't noticed it and the tech support on the phone didn't suggest that as the solution to the problem of the camera not working, even though the operating system reported that the device was functioning normally. As a result, I sent the computer to Tennessee, and the tech person there called me with the news.
else	how about providing a shipping box - we deal with Dell and they provide a shipping box for returns
else	Links for instructional videos were not correxct
else	It was very long to go through all your options on the phone but apart from that it was brilliant.
else	This is not the first time that Lenovo has sent a technician out with the wrong part. The technicians need to be instructed to (1) bring the right part and (2) check that the part they think they have is actually what they have prior to arrival. The technician was very friendly and competent once he got here, but scheduling with him was difficult, and I was very frustrated to again have to schedule twice because he didn't have the right piece at the first visit.
else	Make sure you test or ask for other details not given on telephone.
else	I shipped the unit in the original box and Styrofoam. it was not returned in the same box. I wish to have the box and Styrofoam returned.
else	Poor service I have ever received. My problem was solved but till the date I submitted my laptop for repair to you service center parts other than the affected part were functioning properly. Now my CD player has stopped working and there is a defect which has arised on the body of my laptop.I did not know that after submitting my laptop for a certain minute problem you will create other defects in my laptop. I am very disgusted by your services.
else	I had to wait for a part for almost 15 Days.
else	Worst customer service..repeated mails and messages and tweets to your company, CEO all ignored and never a response received for harassment, misinformation, hiding of information and error not resolved.
else	Shorter waiting time on phone
else	Call rather than email when discovering an issue or not seeing the issue replicated at the service centre. I had to call after getting an email saying that the issue could not be replicated and that the laptop was going to be returned unless I got back to them. I did call and after talking to them, it was decided to replace the wifi card and the problem (intermittent) has totally gone away. Actually speaking to a customer can be most helpful and I encourage this.
else	It needed a part cant remember
else	Ensure that the replacement part is not broken when it's unpacked
else	I didn't receive service - not required since I resolved the issue prior to the local service tech receiving the part. To improve service, get the required part to the local technician faster.  3 weeks is too long.
else	Faster repair times; don't make me have to follow up to get it completed
else	After one week after the return of my deice the camera again is no where to be found. I still have a warranty for 506 days left. The only thing I have installed is malware bytes. His Lenovo device has this installed and it does not affect his device. I would like a refund ( which I know will not happen ) so I could go get a new device.
else	Send parts that are not defective! The service person was very helpful !
else	I sent the projector in for replacement in it's original packaging including protective case. I received the new projector promptly but no case.
else	The tech who came is great, but the phone support is terrible.  I told the guy I needed the bezel around the monitor replaced 5 times and he didn't send the part.  As a result, the client didn't have their laptop for 5 days.  The tech who came has worked with us for years, he called asking us exactly what was wrong and when I told him exactly, he did confirm that Lenovo support did not send enough parts.  So he had to order it in order to make it a one time visit and he helped to expedite it as well.
else	Hire engineers, adhere to the next business day warranty, get parts in stock
else	Shipment of parts was too late, need to expedite this process. Rest all, good!
else	The machine was still not working when it was returned to me
else	Ensure your technician working on the equipment check all hardware is updated with latest firmware etc. my keyboard was replaced multiple times and still had same issue. It ended up being something else that needed to be updated in order for all issues to resolve.
else	I received very poor service to the point that an escalation request was submitted. I was told I would hear back from someone in 1-3 business days and heard back from no one.
else	Advise of necessary resets when the computer is returned. Auto time set not working. Required sign-on to Microsoft to recover custom dictionary. No other issues so far.
else	Send the parts to the correct service center. I took my product to a service center in Indiana, and the replacement parts were sent to a different service center in Kalamazoo Michigan. 100 miles away.
else	"Improve quality control so brand new units don't fail in the first weeks of use. Improve timeliness, frequency, and substantive content of communication with customers who have mailed in units for repair. Improve efficiency of repair process so customers aren't deprived of their systems for so long. Extend warranty for period of time customer was without his/her system as it was being repaired (under warranty). Inform customer of EXACTLY what was done to repair the unit. ""REPLACE PART"" is inadequate information."
else	PC was not fully tested before being returned, I ran memtest86 again and after 2 of 4 passes, there were over 800 memory errors! Also, the first pop-up after starting Windows was to update the bios, like really???  Called and talked to Lenovo agent to find out what was done, learned the motherboard was replaced, so why wasn't the memory tested and bios updated??? Also, I cleaned the laptop inside and out, and packed with the original protection insert (between keyboard & screen) and placed the laptop in the original protective sleeve. Neither were returned... :( I am very disappointed, since my laptop has been unavailable to me since the problems started almost a month ago. Laptop has two 8gb memory dimms, so I removed the top one and I'm in process of running memtest86, so far no errors after 3 of 4 passes. Will swap memory modules and retest to see if the other dimm is the problem. Too bad Lenovo support could could find and fix this since it was pretty clear that one or both memory modules were defective. Unfortunately, the screen grabs included with the returned laptop were ignored. Laptop was also dirty when returned... Sad!
else	Replace battery to pen update drivers and Microsoft updates
else	I had an a-typical return process because my mother sent back the wrong phone.  Everyone was very nice and understanding, and took care of the problem to make both me and my mom very happy.  We have been long-term moto users, and will continue to stay loyal!
else	The Google play services does not update. With  no update in Google play services all the Google app also not working .so I request u to make some update in this applications so my phone work properly as earlier..thank you
else	When the machine was returned there were errors on immediate bootup, and we tried to resolve them over several hours of troubleshooting, eventually only a complete wipe and reinstall of Windows was able to resolve. When PCs are returned, I would expect that these are resolved before returning a machine with multiple errors that seemes to be due to a hardware incompatibilty with the operating system.
else	system software not working as expected so come with better update .
else	Improve support.lenovo.com ticket updates
else	Friendlier receptionist, faster service, frequently update on the progress via email/sms.
else	Make sure the returns department can make outside calls.
else	It took rather a long time for the disks to arrive after I order them, order was placed on 17/05 disks arrived 12/06.
else	Please cross-check the part before sending it to the on-site
else	Try to reduce waiting times to speak to someone
else	My computer was not returned
else	Finding a phone number after trying to use online support was not easy.
else	Keep more parts in stock to minimize the shipping delays.
else	I received a replacement phone that has the same defect as the original phone I sent in to Motorola.
else	Better communication between the Engineers and Lenovo team in terms of parts that have arrived. This is because the engineer came yesterday stating a new motherboard was sent to me and I had no email sent to me regarding this. As soon as the engineer left, the motherboard arrived. Therefore Lenovo recommended me to send the unit back to them to perform further repairs.
else	I had to call at least 5 times to get this repair completed. Your phone menus suck, there are redundant options, it was impossible to find the number on your site, and the hold times are bad. Once I had shipped in my headset I received no notifications on where it was, and the service rep wasnt even able to tell me.
else	Time frame for response and resolution of the service
else	Resolve the problem I contacted CS about
else	Just test your machines whether every parts work or not before selling it.
else	Multiple issues with this service experience:1) Scheduling of visit was a hassle, had multiple call-backs and reschedules before a tech actually came to the house2) Tech was not familiar with the hardware at all.  As a result, he was not able to correctly install the new LCD panel.  He tried, however when the machine was reassembled half of the display did not work correctly.  He had spent 4 hours on the problem at this point and left saying he could come back.  I personally disassembled the machine, reinstalled the LCD (it was seated incorrectly by the tech) and discovered that he had not properly seated 3 connectors during reassembly.  After I completed my disassembly and reassembly of the machine, it worked properly.3) During my disassembly (after the tech had made an attempt) I noticed that 6 assembly screws and 2 rubber bushings located on the speakers were missing, presumably the tech had lost them during the process.  I still do not have these parts and had to substitute parts of my own that are less than ideal.I don't blame the tech entirely on this one - he could have done better but it was obvious he did not have access to proper training and/or information regarding this system.  This is essential if Lenovo is going to offer an on-site service plan.  Otherwise I think customers are better off sending in their hardware to a service center where properly trained technicians can work on it.
else	Lenovo never responded to my support inquiry!
else	Better cost for spare parts as the third party vendor are quoting higher.
else	Wrong parts were sent twice and then once the correct parts were installed the screen no longer worked. The laptop has been sent for service at the depot.
else	Need to set feedback by call. My battery issue is not solved still suffer from same.
else	Replace new parts
else	Ontime resolution with proper tests before handing over to end user
else	1) Keep a log of previous repairs and refer to it. I have received service for the same problem 3 times - first two the same solution was used, obviously not solving the problem. This 3rd time it has been temporarily resolved and it is creeping back in.
Agent	My speakers (which I had kept from a HP Desktop) were not working - your agent had them working in 1 to 2 minutes after getting control of my computer.
else	Phone reps should clearly identify what parts they are sending, why, and how/when they will arrive.  I got a lot of misinformation from one tech, I hardly know where to begin.
else	No coordination between getting the part delivered and having a technician call me. I had to call 3 times over 3 days to get a technician to call me
else	Havent yet received the laptop back. The laptop was deposited with the service centre people on 04.05.2018. Today is 22.05.2018. Almost 19 days have passed by.
else	please do not use low quality refurbished replacement part for on-site service
else	Problem reoccurrence and now battery issues along with freeze up
else	Stock more parts, have the technician actually schedule the next day once parts are available. Not call on Monday with them saying the plan on coming thursday or friday depending on their schedule.
else	Fix my laptop in the time frame promised in my service warranty - next business day (with a day or two allowed for shipping a needed part).
else	tried to fix problem but gave up and suggested I call Microsoft
else	contact information was not updated.
else	Computer after service became slow
else	Get the right parts our to Lenovo Tech
else	We were told there was water damage to the unit.  There was no communication or option to make any choices.  It was it's broken and cannot be fixed.   So we now have a tablet that is non functional with no options to fix or replace it.
else	Provide more updates to customers on the estimated collection date.
else	The on line update status needs improving.
else	The poor satisfaction has nothing to do with the technician who was very professional--I would give him a 10/10 satisfaction rating. I am not satisfied with the fact the part replaced (the screen) within a day began to exhibit issues that were not even there before it was replaced. Also, the amount of time I've had to personally spend on the phone (both on hold and having to make follow-up calls) contacting Lenovo about this issue (and the issue prior to it) has been exasperating--especially since I paid for next business day repair warranty and there is no timeline on when the parts to fix the screen will arrive let along when the screen will be replaced.
else	I purchased my computer and the screen went dark after an update and two months of ownership.  I never got a full explanation of what the problem was and my computer was returned without it's original power cord.  This experience has ensured that I will not purchase another Lenovo product anytime soon.  I simply wanted a second unit in case my main computer was not available.  I was very disappointed with this computer as I use the X1 Carbon at work, and have not have a problem with it.
else	Send the correct part - Correct details on how to return
else	try to improve your technical support. I am not happy at all with technical support.
else	I was told that I would have a service rep contact me within 3 business days to schedule a time for a repair tech to come to me to repair the laptop. No one has called me to schedule a time and no one has come to fix the laptop.
else	Check on the quality and installation of the parts.
else	Provide a telephone number that allows access to telephone operator
else	part received waiting for engineer
else	It is very difficult to get status updates for my product.  Please do something to make this process easier.  I also would like a chat feature which would help immensely with the accent on both ends of the conversation.
else	Computer was returned with same problem. Contacted Lenovo to discuss hard drive not connected. Your rep diagnosed the problem and asked us to return for repair. I hope this does the trick.
else	Please take note that the service is not fixed on phone. I am fed up with your Service Centre in Kuala Lumpur. Sent-in laptop in mid April. Checking and obtaining replacement part quotation took 1 month until mid May. Upon payment, waiting for replacement part to arrive for another 2 weeks. During collection upon done, waiting for additional 1 & 1/2 hour just for testing and checking. But prior to collection, being informed was ready to collect. Wasting our time. Lenovo is way behind from HP and Dell. No matter how efficient you are, please well-train your staff at Service Centre how to do deal better with the customer. Lack of follow-up, no response to email. Terrible service ever.
else	the phone options to get to the tech could be better.
else	faster replacement parts
else	Faster resolution. 2 days or less.
else	Better call center that doesn't lie about when a technician will come out.
else	Easier recovery process for failed IME firmware update? ;)
else	The part has arrived and is on hold @ UPS, but no technician has contacted me to schedule replacement.
else	Hire a better technical team
else	it took two weeks for a technician to arrive and install the replacement part, turned out the replacement was faulty.
else	The several times I have ordered or had to have warranty repair service/support have been overall unsatisfactory. Your systems, processes, and staffing need a complete overhaul
else	"When I followed my carrier's advice (Republic Wireless) about getting my ""ghost screen"" Moto G4 replaced, and called your Moto Cares phone number, I was shocked to learn I had only 5-7 days to return the old phone once I received the new one, as I knew I had to wait for a new SIM card from Republic Wireless before I could activate the new phone, and would have to keep trying to use the malfunctioning one. On top of that I had major surgery scheduled, and would be recovering while waiting for that stupid SIM card because Republic didn't have the SIM cards in stock, delaying the order, and then bad weather delayed UPS, I called Moto asking for an extension of the 5-7 days for returning the old phone. Your representative said ""Sure, we won't charge your credit card the $200 and you can have 10 more days"" YET I HAD NO PROOF OF THAT, he could provide me verification of that extension. So for days I worried Motorola would be charging me $200! Your return timeline for the bad phones is vague and awkward, and very, very stressful.Also, when I FIRST called, the girl told me I *had to agree* to a total cost of over $250! This included the $200 ""deposit"" you attached to my credit card dependent on my sending back the old phone, but also, she said, tax. I knew getting the new phone would cost $24.99, and I happily paid that, but the other +$25 that she was incapable of justifying stank of extortion. There is no way you could charge a 100% tax on $24.99! Luckily I was NOT charged that extra fee/tax/rip-off, but what is up with Motorola DEMANDING overpayment be approved by the consumer? Not cool Motorola!"
else	I believe wrong replacement part was initially delivered, thus causing original on-site technician appointment to be rescheduled. This caused a a day or 2 of delay but really not a big deal and transparent to me.
else	I contacted Technical Support 2 times. The first technician that I spoke to over the phone was not very helpful and seemed to want to get me off the phone as soon as possible. He also was unable to fix my issue. I would have appreciated if he had taken more time to troubleshoot the issue, as the second technician that I spoke with was able to fix my issue almost immediately and reported that it was a known issue.
else	When the ticket was initially logged I did not receive a conformation and no follow up. It wasn't until I called the service desk did they give me an update.. The initial reference I got when logging the ticket on the website was also different to what was logged with the service desk..
else	Provide us with ETA; Frequent (daily) updates on the status
else	Speed up the return of my product, as it has now been out of my possession for at least 7 weeks.
else	replace my defective lap top with a brrand new replacment. Same model not looking for an upgrade. Just what I paid. A good working system Which I DON'T have today.
else	Faster problem diagnose and provide parts earlier
else	Better communication regarding receiving of device and  return
else	Streamline the process: Make repair requests easier to request and speed up the shipping process by using faster shipping methods.
else	The phone provided for service was in working condition and now The phone returned is not in working condition
else	update the training videos for your mirage daydream VR headsets.  Expeditions does not work exactly the same way your videos say they do.
else	Send the correct working parts to the on-site technician
else	Prevent the same issue from reoccurring
else	Better feed back on the status process had to keep calling back to get it moved from Service ticket entered to then getting parts ordered then to get service scheduled.
else	Our computer was not built when it was first went to us then we had to wait over 20 days for them to returned and then this one was not working.
else	The only problem was the difficulty of understanding the technician due to background noise.
else	fault rates with this unit are an issue. I would not go out of way to purchase. yes they all get repaired but rather not have the fault in the fist place and have had a lot.
else	Should not have to pay for shipping to return the defective product that is under warranty
else	"Quicker turnaround time or clearer updates on the status of the computer. The website indicated my computer was resting in the ""depot"" for over two months!"
else	When hardware is being sent out, it would be better to not state in the ticket that it is a Customer Replaceable Unit all the time. This is confusing for people who receive parts and are expecting a tech to come onsite.
else	Getting updates was difficult.  When I entered my information, I constantly got an error message.  Plus the part that was needed was not in stock so I had a longer wait than expected.
else	Send the right parts the first time round
else	Final appointment cancelled on the day, 5th March, told you would contact to rearrange and have heard nothing since. This issue was first raised with you in the middle of December and is still not resolved.

else	Didn't got the resolution for the first time..!!
else	You can make it easier to contact you. The problem is still unresolved. I am still waiting for you to register 3 years on site warranty purchased on a machine September 2016.We have been unable to use the laptop in question for months it is our only spare for the teachers. Not at all happy. This does not encourage us to purchase Lenovo again.
else	Follow-up with the customer within 24-hours about the state of their service request, particularly if that customer has a next day on-site warranty.
else	"I bought my phone less that 30 days from when I had to send it back,  I did not receive a ""like new"" device.  It had scratches and debris in sim holder.  I bought a brand new phone.  I had to send the replacement device back because it kept restarting, had a flickering screen and finally shut down and refused to cut back on.  N top if this,  your warranty department refused to send another phone stating ""policy"" to me.   I can understand if I have had the phone for 60 days or more.  I am on going to recieve my 3rd phone in less than 35 days.  Ridiculous.   I am currently without a phone.  I have not had a phone for almost a week because of a poor product and bad customer service.   Again,  I have had the phone for less than 30 days.  I will never do business with you again."

else	Better follow up of initial problem as it took a long time between the first site visit and the second site visit to fix the problem
else	More professional approach.
else	The return was shipped after a month long struggle with the payment porta trying to go through the premium service. Th payment would not go through  with my card which resulted in a hold of around 2000$ in total  with multiple tries as suggested by motorla customer care everytime I reach out to them . then the replacement device shipped was locked. And now I had to process another replacement.
else	Speed up return process
else	Make sure the correct parts are ordered.
else	Problem with full address not showing up on delivery part. part was not delivered because of this. this has happened several times with your system

else	There was a problem in phone that the vibrator of phone is sometime working and sonetime not . So i went to customer service center but they first take my phone update the software and said it was ok. but later that day i found the same problem the next day i went they said your phone has no problem as i am making that up when i show the problem they start blaming memory card then i have to show again when memory card was out really felling so humilated .. i Am very dissatisfied by your service i will not recommend anyone to again go there

else	The repair took a very long time.
else	There was a two week wait time for the part to be delivered to the technician. I was promised three days. This was extremely upsetting to me. The technician, however, was fantastic.
else	I clearly informed the tech that the issue was with the bluetooth device. They claim to have replaced the motherboard, but they appear to have simply reinstalled windows. After installing windows updates the bluetooth device no longer functions.
else	No response from Lenovo till date
else	Allow the Field tech to order the parts he needs
else	at your authorized service center they are asking for invoice copy where as on mobile it already displayed that mobile is in warranty. without invoice they not accepted any service request.as per my knowledge you are having your system from that you can track all details of mobile purchase.this is very worst condition of the center. if you want to talk with me regarding this issue please call me on 8898880098.
else	1. Keep the states updated, and also have the detail of the states. Ex: parts are not available, WHEN will it be in stock.  2. PLEASE make sure everything work after repair. This is not my first time I sent my laptop back. The same thing happens after I receive my laptop from repair, within a month?! I HAVE TO send it back to you again. 3. It took FOREVER to get the repair done. I can't do my work.
else	More explicit status update
else	I am still waiting for a call back to begin the replacement process.  I have received a survey about support prior to even starting the support process.
else	provide customers with competent and professional technicians. The technician he had, had a very strong cigarette odor and his body odor was of relevance.
else	Send an onsite engineer that's more professional and I'm on warranty for a reason and the laptop did not stop working because of that minimal rust so pls
else	I received a 2 week delayed email about the motherboard being installed.  I already had the computer home and their was no identification of the repair when the actual computer was returned.
else	1) provide a dedicate telephone number after logging a complaint/service order on line - rather than emailing a phone number that requires going through multiple extensions 2) a single number for that complaint rather than an eticket+Account ID+Service order Numbers 3) please have Lenovo on all email correspondence (makes finding them easier) ie automat@ctdi.com
else	Wrong part was initially sent, but was resolved quickly
else	Assitant who took my call was not particularly helpful. Was quite negative - suggested that cost of repair might exceed the cost of a new tablet (needed new micro usb port). When I gave him my post code for issuing a returns label, he was able to call up the correct company name and address but when he emailed the label to me the address was only partial and insufficient for the postal service. I subsequently found a local repair man who carried out the repair for less than 20.
else	Because the problems I was facing are not here in this updated version
else	Reduce waiting window, currently is set like 12pm-5pm, I have to wait long.Improve parts inventory to reduce long waiting.
else	Kindly hire and train your customer care staff at Mysore centre  to be more professional and customer friendly. They should inform the customer the following  A) Full details of the problem in there product. B) The details of the part that is being replaced in the product. ( Product Serial Number)  C) The number of Days it takes to rectify the problem. D ) Terms of Warranty for the parts Changed.

else	Don't make me correspond with the customer relations department by email. I keep asking Efthimia to ring me (as there is no phone number in her signature tag) but she won't.
else	my issue is not resolved even after shipping my laptop and waiting for return, lenovo described issue has been resolved but it is not yet.
else	It used to be that we would order on site service and the tech would come the next day. In this case the part was shipped to the hotel and I didn't receive a call from the Tech until almost a week later
else	"Your new computers should automatically detect driver issues with peripherals, especially Lenovo peripherals, and update them so that they can work properly. In my case the problem I was experiencing indicated a problem with accessing the BIOS, but turned out to be a problem with a multi port ""docking station that I bought at the same time as the computer."

else	Need to feed back information instead of me chasing an update on my machine every week.
else	Keeping in line with a previous response, sending regular updates on the progress of the machine will better meet my expectations
else	We requested to get this back numerous times and dint hear anything. We was waiting weeks to receive it back, also we rang numerous times and we spoke to someone as said they couldn't find any history off the request even though we gave them the request number and once he said he found it he said he was going to transfer us but just put it down. Lack off communication and urgency.
else	So far I have not received any information on when my laptop will be fixed.  I was on the phone with Lenovo for 50 mins waiting for someone to answer, I was then told to contact another vendor.  They in turn said they can't handle the recall issue and I needed to call Lenovo back.  My issue is still outstanding.

else	I don't even remember why I called.
else	Send parts with overnight shipping

else	Lenovo did their part in replacing the system board, however, Marriott is unable to provide a bit locker number to get the computer running.  I have to send in the computer to re-image.
else	Not return my computer with a new promblem which didn't exist prior
else	Time to deliver the parts
else	Extend warranties when some parts are replaced.
else	Please make the service timely and keep us updated regarding our product.
else	Better Level Receiving calls on the call center who deal with customers as customers not giving them attitudes , Give Time and Schedules to Resolve the issue , Not open ended answers , have the right parts shipped , No case should be closed after 3 days without the case being solved and confirmed with customer .
else	Machine was returned without completing requested work
else	For an large client like Qantas, you should have onsite warranty not return to base.
else	I received a replacement phone for one that was broken.
else	Nobody from Lenovo has called me to address the issue
else	Improve the on-line site to make phone number accessible.
else	I contacted the support line and left a message with my case number and never received a call back from support.
else	"Have more parts available in stock or on demand. We always have to ""wait"" several days for parts on back order. Causing delays, frustrated users, and unnecessary communications back and forth etc."
else	better communication around part delays
else	Communication, I never received any email feedback as to when the engineer was scheduled to arrive.
else	Laptop was pulled apart in October 17 same problem happened March 18 and it still keeps crashing. Not Happy.
else	Include instructions on how to remove the hard drive from the bracket.  The Lenovo website only had instructions on how to remove the hard drive bracket from the computer.  I had to search the internet to discover that I had to bend the edge of the plastic bracket to remove the hard drive.  It took me over 30 minutes to find this solution on the internet.
else	This is the second time i've had to send my laptop in for this same issue. Not only that, but when I received my laptop back from the depot this time, they didn't send me my charger. It's been over a week and I still have not received it, despite numerous calls to customer support.
else	Quicker delivery of the parts.
else	more updates, access to current status, description of problem, and better chat service
else	There was no update on the status through emails. It was order open and closed with out any information. It would be great to provide what is going on and help customer understand the status and how long approx it takes
else	Maintain quality of your product and introduce better people to fix the units within warranty period , better communication with customer & drastically need toImprove turnaround time when the unit is sent to repair .
else	Very very tired of feedback, forever very bad services despite i made countless complain and feedback still the same, the VP VERY VERY SCARED TO CALL ME.
else	Simplify call logging process.
else	Provide more updates on why it is taking to so long to resolve an issue.  Provide the correct part when fixing the device
else	Lenovo had to send out the same part out twice because the first one was a refurbished board that didn't work.  The board had missing parts on it.
else	Not sell laptops which have such little memory that they cant even install a security update! I used to love Lenovo now I just feel like Ive been sold a faulty product which I dont know what to do with.
else	i have returned the earlier Moto X4 beacuse it is not charging, but till then it used to get fully charged in 50 min. But the current mobile is taking more than 1 1/2 Hours to fully charge. and the battery is discharging very fast when compared to my original piece.. Seriously i am not at all satisfied with the replaced product
else	every time when we share you error number your representative reply it is invalid number, but it shows us, so always we have to send you screenshots & then only u believe , it should not happens, you should update your database properly & correctly
else	Faster repair/improvement/resolution
else	If a new  laptop requirse 3 visits and still no resolution the best course of action would have been to replace the laptop.Also response time is extremely bad from the support engineers.
else	There was issue with Harddrive and after resolution touch pad is not working
else	it would have been informative if the cause of fault and resolution was explained.(in laymans terms)
else	If a part required for repair is not in stock the support team sometimes have no eta. This can be annoying as we can not tell our end user an eta either.
else	Speed of replacement parts, speed of customer service is truly the worst I have seen in 35 years. I will not recommend Lenovo to anyone I want to keep as a friend.
else	Resolve the issue of phone getting heated after I accepted system update.
else	After I receive the laptop back, give me a better idea of what work was done on the laptop
else	Follow up with service orders Ensure that parts  and service were delivered
else	Better attention to detail when shipping parts would be helpful.
else	be more on time
else	know more updated in frequent basis
else	Train designated staff to instruct consumers how to process their warranty returns in a timely fashion. Streamline the process and make it user friendly.
else	Worst service ever I've receive They didn't even assemble my laptopThere is noise of screw I can here , when rotatedI ignored once but my cpu fan started noise due to that screwHope I have to go backI'm tired of your servicesShame on you
else	hopefully lenovo  can support old models at elast 3 years behind.. its hard to request parts for out of warranty  OOW units.  and hoping that lenovo will provide us a price list.. compared to ASUS we have an acces to all parts price for in-warranty and out of warranty units.  and we can give emedietly price feed back to the client...
else	test your hardware and keep track of it
else	The people infront of service centre was not behaving as technical..very poor service exprinced by me..the girl on counter number 5 was replying like i dnt knw for any query....poor service ever...
else	Thoroughly test al items before returning
else	next day service is never next day - it always takes 2, even if I call in the morning
else	Take the initative to provide update instead of having the customers call them.Be more sure of what they are doing instead of always asking the customer to wait.
Agent	Service times, Reply times and everything in between.Customer rep was very blunt and rude in emails.
else	Long phone queue so tested MTSA but sparepart order issue. Make it easier to caontact support and have someone check MTSA more often.
else	Improve shipment times, the repair was delayed a day since the shipment waited until the next business day to be shipped
else	Please make your process flow of selections over the call to reach an executive less branched. I expect to speak someone after two or three selections. Waiting time seemed like years!
else	experdite the waiting process and make parts available more readily
else	Transfer all the information I provided to the call agent to the vendor who actually does the work.  The vendor showed me her screen, it only contained the bare minimum information like customer name, telephone number, address, serial number.  Al the time I spent explaining the issue to the call agent went to waste.  Even SLA information was not transmitted.  Vendor offerred to fix issue after SLA period.  I had to escalate all the way to management before vendor would come on the last day of SLA.
else	Wrong part dispatched.
else	As of now, we didn't get any negative feedback from user, hence maintain the same.
else	Ideally, I would not like to spend 134 days awaiting resolution to the specifications I gave within my original email. Additionally, communications were poorly worded, and difficult to understand.
else	problem is not the product but the sales team didn't mention this docking not able to charge notebook.  Who want a docking not able to charge notebook and sales team didn't even mention about it.  maybe they don't even know at all!!
else	The solution did not return PC to original level of functionality
else	Computer returned from 8 weeks at Lenovo Kentucky facility but will not work.
else	It's my Second time visit to service center within 1 Month for same problem at 1st time for same problem they changed my Mother Board and on second visit they had changed the Display without confirming what's is the actual problem they started to Experiments on my mobile phone which cause me huge waste for time visiting service center and asking whether I phone is now repaired or not. I still doubts that the same problem where my Screen stop working will happen again, but if we do restart then the problem is solved but what is the permanent solution for that?....I would like to Ask for the Replacement for my Motor 4 Plus phone because it's defective and you cannot detect it then please provide Replacement with good working Mobile.I hope you believe how customer valuable response because after spending the money to buy such costly phone and facing the same issue within 1 year of guarantee, that to shame full to be happened with such a big brand like Motorola I never expected the such bad service.Thanks
else	Don't order a recall with parts in stock. A Carbon laptop should be replaced instead of being repaired in the first year.
else	Be quicker to update the status on the computer, instead of waiting until someone calls to do so. There should be an automotive system when the computer arrives and goes from one technician to another.
else	Be faster,update and inform why we wait.
else	I mentioned the problems with my Laptop upon return.
else	The website was difficult to use when I purchased the laptop, in particular finding accessories. The description information given on the customization page wasn't enough. Had to navigate to the accessory page and sometime search outside the Lenovo page (Youtube/Google) to find which parts would be compatible with the laptop. I also couldn't change the address associated with the Lenovo ID, there's no easy way to change email address. Sent a message to support using the contact form, got a reply saying the message hadn't been dispatched. Lots of little issues with buying the product on the site. On the phone support is perfect, but on the website some hiccups.
else	To cut down the time to deliver the replacement parts to Next Business Day.  Otherwise Lenovo's Aftersales is like at the bottom tier in terms of service reliability.  We consumers are looking at efficient Aftersales support to compliment your product offerings.
else	not  have to  call  twice
else	It took many contacts to the support number to get a resolution. I reported the problem on 3/12, was initially told my machine would be replaced, got a call from support sayign it would be repaired. When the service tech arrived, he quickly determined that my PC could not be repaired and needed to be replaced. (that's what I was told initially).
else	Lenovo should improve its technical assistance on priority basis.
else	Provide a BIOS update for the built-in diagnostics so that no false positive will be reported. https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/HT082328
else	Fix the problem with the track pad button.  QA/QA does not appear to exist
else	Cut short trouble shooting on phone as we are not technical person to do various steps asked on phone before sending technicians
else	Reception of call wasn't the best
else	Following the initial report on Wednesday  I was sent an email saying I would be updated and an engineer would contact me, didn't get any contact until I rang Lenovo on Tuesday the next week chasing and was told anengineer had visited and mended the laptop, but as id had no contact thiswas an error, I then was told as that icedent numer was closed they would raise a new one. again the standard email says I will be updated but no further email response from lenovo. Engineer attended my office to work on laptop on Thursday after delivery of a part and couldn't fix it, and left a message with a coleegue that he would be back on Monday, didn't turn upon Monday so I rang Tuesday to be informed the part had been ordered and engineer would be back on Thursday to fit. This info could have been confirmed to me by email but again I had to chase to get the info.there seems to be a disconnect between the call centre and the engineers, once the job is passed onto the engineer then the call centre don't seem to review the case and send out updates.I was without my laptop for 2 weeks form the intial report of the problem to lenovo when I was advised by ourLaingorourke IT dept that it should be a next day service.
else	Still waiting to for box and shipping label to send to Lenovo
else	I was never told what was wrong with my device and this is the second time I had to send it in for repair.
else	Share findings on the machine and clear it with the customer, without sending the machine after a problem was diagnosed. May be the grounds, on which you're returning the device are not true.
else	Create an independent customer service department to take care of customer problems not only customer orders
else	Make the warranty phone number stand out from the  rest.
else	Not let customers wait 3 weeks for a part.
else	depot returned computer with issue not resolved
else	Ensure the correct part is sent.
else	improving upon software issues, and crashes if the updates are delayed or update gets stuck in between
else	Send an email with the proposed resolution/next steps before dispatching personnel and equipment. I got an email saying a part was shipped for self-service repair without any other information. The next day, an onsite technician called me for a same-day appointment, but this was the first I had heard Lenovo would be sending a technician. The technician also had the part with him, rather than it being shipped to me. My experience with the onsite repair was good, but the confusion before the actual repair needs to be fixed.
else	Get parts faster
else	The email I received from sending my box into Motorola claimed that FedEx would provide a free box time ship the phone in. They did not. That email is also full of typos and should be updated. Everything with the phone replacement was fine, but I would have liked to know if Motorola even tried to repair my original device (the Sim card slot was jammed).
else	It wasn't clear which help line to call for my product (Yoga 920)
else	Have a return to base warranty locally
else	Pc was received back severely damaged during shipping  can not reply to any questions here because had to send it back
else	improve the quality of the plugs you have on the  charger unit.
else	8 for timeframe because we're in Tasmania so sometime it takes awhile to get parts. 8 for repair status not for this case but because sometimes in the past we've had to chase them up. We're really happy with the product. We're in a school and they really stand up to the punishment of the students.
else	There was a shipping delay in sending the part to me.
else	The replacement phone I received is broken. It keeps shutting down.
else	Keep us updated via email such as products being shipped to site.
else	Faster return.
else	Be honest about how long it's going to take to get an item delivered. Don't close the file just because you've shipped the part.
else	Computer was returned damaged
else	attend the case on time
else	The refurbished phone that I received has display issues.
else	Improve the stock of parts reserved for high-end PC like workstation P series
else	By speeding up the process of hardware delivery to the technical team.By making a few more Lenovo Service Centers available at other end of the city.
else	Improve returns to depot
Agent	The first person I chatted with didnt even attempt to help. So I decided to call and that made a world of difference. Had the interaction stopped at first agent I would have thought your product was poor quality. The person I spoke with on the phone changes my perspective. All of your representatives need to care for the customer and not disconnect them.
else	Take a long time to receive my phone
Agent	Do not put me on hold when I ask for a supervisor
else	They need to improve the quality of the part special in LCD cover  for Lenovo T450 because it easy to break the cover.
else	1. It was slightly difficult to track down the information regarding the warranty and receiving support.2. It would have been great to get update emails on progress.  It took longer to resolve the issue than the set expectation, so getting an email resetting expectations would have been appreciated.
else	change my motherboard on time
else	Lenovo should take care of the service which is told to be done on priority especially in the corporate world and should align such engineers who are very serious about the user satisfaction and the security of the device as your service engineer has not taken any security measure for the safety of my device and even the part was not having the barcode on it. One important thing is that your engineer didn't bring the part in the seal pack box. How can be reliable on him that he has brought the genuine part of my device?
else	Employ better professionals for servicing laptops and for communication
else	part issue
else	Probably reduce wait times
else	The replacement part was not immediately available, so we had to wait several days for the service call.  I know you can't keep spares for everything, just wanted to mention this.
else	A few less steps in the evaluation process before the return.
else	Laptop parts is damage so please check every part clearly...
else	provide soft ware repair/help at no charge.  Especially one that is only 2 days old.  My wifi disconnects anytime I try to connect printer. Have talked with service provider and your people.
else	Send new and functional parts - the system board received was defective. Send skilled technician - the technician on site wasn't able to properly install the parts and left with the computer not working. Extremely disappointed and frustrated by the service and will never purchase a Lenovo product again.
else	The fact that my notebook completely became in responsive due to an automatic update that was occurring is insane. IDont how if its automatically updating , my computer was useless unless I restarted it with the help of customer support .
else	I had a hard time hearing the phone tech and had to have him repeat things a couple of times.
else	Track part orders better and communicate better with end user.
else	While it is still under warranty, i shouldn't have to pay to send it in to get fixed.  Then when it was returned it wouldn't work.  Was it tested before returning?  I was told this is unusual for this machine to have problems, did I get a lemon.  It is taking more time for the service team and me, than the machine is worth.  It might be cheaper just to send a new unit.
else	Give phone reps access to more information in terms of what they can view on their screens to let users know when to expect parts, not just give them tracking numbers for UPS, I can check a tracking number myself.
else	Gave up on waiting for the recovery disc!  It never arrived as promised.  Horrible customer service...
else	Improve parts availability
else	Actually perform next day repairs, not reschedule multiple times.
else	"Allow me to exchange a bad computer directly through Lenovo instead of transferring me 10 times to get an answer of: ""You have to contact the 3rd party seller that you purchased the PC from."" It was not fun being transferred around and even less fun to get an answer stating Lenovo could not do anything for me."
else	Wrong diagnostic and wrong parts
else	Again, we knew the issue was the charging port, but that didn't get fixed until the third attempt.
else	Fix the problem first time around, or replace unit with a new one.
else	Still waiting for engineer to arrive to install parts
else	Long hold times, but the call back feature worked as advertised
else	As a customer who had paid for additional 3 year on-site warranty, I was really disappointed with the time it took for Lenovo to send me the repair parts, also a wrong part was sent which caused further delay.  I was unable to use my laptop for more than 2 months.  I really hope Lenovo improves its management of repair parts - please make it more timely and accurate.
else	When my order was originally called in (late April 2018), they told me that they were waiting on a part that should have arrived by 5/1/18. When I called back in late May 2018, the part had arrived and they had apparently just forgotten about me. This was not the technician's fault.
else	waiting time on customer service line
else	Deliver updates sooner
else	Fingerprint Reader did not work upon return.
else	Get your parts organization working better.
else	Be more streamlined in their communication between departments, and between customer service and in the field technicians. Also, they sent the wrong replacement part to the technician so they were not able to complete the repair.
else	I made several attempts to get a call back with no response.
else	more communication about the return delivery
else	deliver parts overseas
else	Provide shipping and a shipping container for returning an item.
else	Technician didn't seem to attempt to recreate the problem before returning the laptop. Better communication would have saved a week of useless shipping my laptop back and forth.
else	Listen, read and have someone 2nd check what a Lenovo member decided as a fault and part(s)  to repair the fault.It took 6 calls,  3 visits by your external engineer to rectify the fault. I had to call sales to then be transferred to service because no one was answering the phone after to 30 minutes,  each time.
else	I was refer to serlink and the response is very slow
else	Service counter not fully occupied, waiting time long.
else	It takes far too long to get parts.
else	Actually send email updates so we know what is happening. Got an email to say the call was open and that was it. 3 days later I got a call from the Engineer to say he was coming on site!
else	Better communication between engineers, phone centre and other parties involved, e.g. ATOS
else	the telephone transmission was difficult to understand at times
else	First of all , i have about 10 members in family using Lenovo Phones however i was very dissapointed with the New phone's performance ( Lenovo K6 ) , there is lot of lagg issue.the details ( address / phone number ) of your service center is not updated for Ranchi ( Jharkhand ).The guy who was taking note of the problems which i was facing was very rude and did not know how to behave with the customer.my no is 9835115192let's see what you guys are doing about iti will never suggest anyone to buy lenovo anymore.a dissapointed fan of the produc and service
else	turn up on time. Notify me of the appointment in due time, Do not presume that thinkpads are only used by businesses
else	If there is going to be a wait time to call back the person on the nominated number.
else	the attendant said there were no new parts to my computer. the first attendant did not want to change the motherboard (which was necessary) asked me to update the software. my problem continued and then came the second person and he saw that it was necessary to change and put a reused piece, this was in worse condition than my original, the digital recognition sensor did not work. Then he came back for the third time and put another piece reused again. And then it works now, but I do not know if that piece is of good quality. after the experience of putting a piece worse than the part that I was in trouble, I started to mistrust lenovo's hardware quality.
else	Better test updates.
Agent	too long holding for a rep
else	This item was sent to Lenovo and no updates were given for over a month. Even the online status said it was received with no additional information. We had to call twice to check on the item and still didn't get a date when the product would be repaired. Thankfully, once the product was repaired and sent back it worked as expected.
else	Not have a box sent first thing to return the notebook for service.  This is a business laptop and I can't be without it for more than a few days.  Instead, I went to a Lenovo service center and they sorted it out in one hour.
else	parts were not shipped on time. And when they have now arrived, I can't get a hold on the onsite technician assigned
else	Faster shipping of replacement parts
else	I had my laptop less than two weeks when it began to fail. A direct replacement should have been in order rather than hold my defective unit for more than a month.
else	Offer more services and training reps to better handle calls regardless of on-going issues or in overall attitude
else	No body has returned my calls
else	make a computer that doesnt break after 6 months and turn around the repair much faster
else	Improve the technical efficiency of sales personnel in store
else	I send it my Think Pad to get service since it has not run from the day I received it.  It was repaired but told I have a bad CRU battery and that was not covered.  I had to speak with a number of people and finally did get a new battery and the machine  is working fine now.
else	The process of repair is too long, it take me 3 weeks times to wait for it. And all Lenovo need to do is just replace a hard drive for my laptop, however, they replace the fine one. HDD is the one that is not working, they replaced the sdd, after all these, i decided just buy a hard drive on amazon. Now all the problems are fixed, Lenovo waste my 3 weeks of time and didn't fix the problem.
else	Speak more slowly and be patient with callers who are in a panic
else	improve your service call response
else	The phone was given back to me after a month.The repair quality was very bad, they used glue to stick the parts of the phone.There were silver colour particles from the insides of the screen, when I asked, the executive said its normal and I need not worry about it.This is the third time I visited the service center, they never repair my phone properly.They do not have the aim of repairing my phone, they worry more about losses if the part is not accepted by the company as under warranty defect. Finally, after several requests they have repaired my phone and today is the first day of use. Its working fine.
else	Sort out your repair times. Don't promise 5 working days for repair if the part is not in stock!
else	Shorter delivery and return time.
else	Continue one ticket until resolution/completion of the service request. In all a total of 4 tickets were created for this one issue. In doing so, on the third ticket, the wrong serial number was entered resulting in the wrong part being sent - and of course, then ticket NUMBER FOUR needing to be created. Consistency and efficiency go a long way.
else	Deliver faulty parts in less than 10 days
else	Avoid repetition of user/requestor information, when requesting service and once service call is started. Make manuals easy to find within the product page. It may save time.
else	Still awaiting a fix
Agent	I had a little trouble understanding the agent due to a heavy accent.
else	Please give the response on time
else	be able to fix my laptop faster
else	respond to customers concerns and explain what and why if you choose another road
else	The first part was not sipped to me.  it was shipped to a depot and the CSR entered in my email in wrong so I wasn't getting notifications.
else	problem (no instructions on installing part) still exists
else	no response from you
else	Always  send tested part
else	Provide automatic driver updates electronically.
else	Call or email with updates. When the customer calls, do not yell and talk down at the customer.
else	more frequent status updates. all I was told is waiting on a part with no timeline for fulfillment.
else	There has been no repsonse in 3 weeks or any attenpt to resolve my problem, support on the phone was very poor, with no knowledge or follow up whatsoever
else	Failures has increased for this particular lot of PCs TS P310 SFF, out of 50, we have faced issue with 9 PCs. And same issue on 7 nos of PCs. Kindly do root cause analysis and provide us permanent solution of problem for all these PCs.
else	Actually send a tech with the requested part. Tech never came and case was closed saying an LCD was replaced, even though it was not the original request and no tech showed up.
else	please reduce operation time
else	Being able to update ticket information and better communication with technician instead of just waiting for a call
else	Motherboard was replaced with faulty part, I expected a faster response to rectify this issue
else	Confirm ETA updates
else	Deploy professional people on field
else	Clearer instructions and directions on what I needed to do
else	Stop using scripts when the person making the call is technically competent; send multiple parts if it's obvious the call might require them. Things that every warranty support service except yours does, basically.
else	By providing services on time
else	Need an exceptions policy if multiple returns needed for manufacturer defect. Just give a new laptop from retailer, or ship new one.
else	spare part / 3 bus days / expect next bus day/ he gets in trouble with the client as he offered next bus day
else	told it was a software issue - to reload the software which came loaded on the system - don't have the software - am waiting on my local IT dept who doesn't have time to work on it
else	Listen to professional customers and address issues immediately. It shouldnt have taken nearly 3 months to resolve the issue.
else	This was the third time that the laptop needed to be repaired - managed to sort out the problem this time but you'd did not let me know what was wrong with it - just received a text to say that it was being shipped back to me and the form that came back with the laptop didn't say much. The second repair back in Oct was disappointing since the repair center were unable to identify the Lenovo power lead as being genuine and I had to make great effort to obtain a receipt - felt really that your repair centre should have access to receipts and of course might be able to identify genuine Lenovo products.
else	include the install instructions OR a link to your online video (excellent BTW) that I had to search for
else	There was no communication after the unit was shipped.  I had to call your tech support to understand why the unit had not been repaired.   I was sent 4 pictures as proof of the problem yet 3 of the 4 pictures were blurry and really told me nothing about the issue
Agent	"9 for product, 3 for customer experience...product transaction, customer care, HW service AND SW service are all disconnected...it makes for a very difficult customer experience...you all are in the tech business, yet your tech can't adequately support the customer's need. Yes my issue may have gotten done, but only through adamant self-advocacy and escalation. So much time and angst to solve the fact that my wifi wouldn't work on a brand new machine...and in the end you couldn't solve it and still wanted to bill the customer for a portion of a two hour old service contract that wasn't necessary according to your own SME to begin with. I love the product but this company is suffering from ""the cobbler's kids have no shoes"" syndrome. Sad, i couldn't even provide a grade there were so many variables to the experience."
else	Get a better phone system and have your service techs speak into their mouth pieces properly. My call had been dropped 5 times. I also would of thought that the service tech would of called me back concerning since the call had been dropped. As to speaking clearly into the mouth pieces some techs were fine such as Ray Griffin and Jerry but others could hardly hear or understand them and had to repeatedly ask them to repeat because I was unable to hear or understand them. After doing the resolution of a bios update walked through by Ray, I had lost the blue tooth signal all together on the computer and unfortunately while trying to resolve that the call had been dropped. Not sure what had happened on why the blue tooth was lost but after calling back three more times Stan was able to walk me through getting the blue tooth back and the blue tooth mouse working again after the January 2 Lenovo update.
else	Supposedly still waiting for part and for a technician to accept assignment for over 2 months.
else	Very poor service provider brand in electronics u have improvement Ur call centre team their is job all staff are fresher they have no product knowledge other brand have good communication staff also products knowledge staff
else	Shorten time held in queue while progressing toward speaking to a service representative.
else	Sell me a computer that does not break down twice, with the same error.
else	Give updates on how long the process may extend when it goes beyond the automatic period of 5-10 business days
else	Since the appointment could not be scheduled for a particular time of the day, the person making the appointment said they would call on the day in the morning to confirm the time. They never did, which was a slight disruption as we had an incident at the time. Good service otherwise, the engineer was professional and the issue was resolved quickly.
else	Improve waiting time, only after 2.5 hours from my initial call was I able to receive any support.
else	If you could update us quoted parts delivery accordingly, eg;- lcd screen that require very long time to arrive after purchased
Agent	Get better staff that are polite and helpful not rude and can not be bothered
else	To improve waiting time
else	The service person never called or showed up
else	I need the software you sold me  and the phone techs need more knowledge
else	Improve parts availability, tech training. Even better if you were to implement hardware exchange.
else	Provide me the service contact
else	faster return will be better.
else	A simple part that is considered broken - MOTHERBOARD - is going to take 1 month to arrive - this has to be some kind of a joke with Lenovo trying to be a truly global company with ambitions. How can you leave a business client without his/her main tool to work for a MONTH (at least)???
else	I have sent this computer in three times (just set again yesterday).  Issues unresolved (after updates hard drives - one or the other- are not recognized). Appears to be a reoccurring issue with this model as a [partner bought this same model and has this issue as well.
else	The woman worked very hard with our own IT department to get my computer up and running.
else	problem has reoccurred several times and the numerous repairs are yet to rectify it for good.
else	Please attend to the issue and replace the problem parts
else	Wifi did not work after performing an update to the phone...
else	Provide some updates on the status
else	Awaiting email to tell me what I was supposed to do next
else	Improve customer service access (response to chat, email call back requests and wait time) Pay better attention to include all parts when returning repaired products
else	package was returned with no notification at all one day i was told there was a package that had been sitting by my door for 2 days
else	Take down the wrong phone numbers especially for Canada that are in circulation, for parts and returns in particular. For my defective product return, I was given 1-877-884-4659 by your representative which kept on answering with an automated message that it was not within the business hours. After wasting almost a day of calling around I was told that I should call 1-855-253-6686 instead. I also found on online forums that people have been complaining about this matter.
else	The auto updates gives the computer a hard time.
else	Because the technicians are not professional
else	Shorter wait times
else	have not recieved unit yet
else	Customer care more prompt n professional
else	Hire a more professional technician.
else	Either fix the problem over the phone, or offer FREE postage label to send unit back in.
else	My laptop does not work still after onsite replacing parts. OS was not installed by the technician and I did not manage to install it by myself from Recovery USB. Then I was waiting for another Recovery USB. Now I'm waiting for a technician again and I will have to take another day off on my job to meet him.
else	Service poor and not on time
else	Provide the correct information when required, we are a GOLD Lenovo partner and having to waste time with support calls is not helpful to promoting a great product.
else	easer to get to find a number to call lenovo
else	Problem was not solved and tech had me run a program to check system which took 2 hours and he promised to call me back to see what may be the problem.  HE NEVER CALLED BACK, problem appears sometimes, not solved
else	just test parts before shipping them to a tech
Agent	I don't feel that the agent really understood the issue, and my issue is still not resolved. However, to be fair to Lenovo, I'm not sure if the issue is a hardware issue (Lenovo) or operating systems issue (Microsoft).
else	More service representatives for a shorter wait
else	Need to close issue on time.
else	The person who contacted me couldn't help with the issue.
else	Provide a holistic global service and take ownership - don t blame another internal department as the customer does not care about internal politics or budget saving
else	Trust your end customer whom lodge a faulty ticket and reduce phone technical checking to the minimum. It will be hard for customer if they do not have technical knowledge.Flexible with expiring of warranty period.
else	Improve your resolution time.
