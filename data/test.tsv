Carry In / Walk - In	need to improve technical services and repair times
Contact Center	Was diverted to a Dutch call centre twice, and was not given much help in trying to get a uk centre,
Agent	Waiting for a follow up that I haven't received.
Depot	Send a text message to the phone number when the computer is mailed back so the owner can be on the lookout for its return.  Lenovo can also give a reason why the computer had the failure that it had and if there is anything that the owner can do to keep it from happening again.
Contact Center	Poor and slow response on a simple quotation
Onsite	After reporting using your online service issue system I got no feedback whatsoever. It was first after (4 days later) I called that something happened.
Onsite	Give the technical support on location asap.
CRU	receive instructions on how to exchange a SSD card
Onsite	Ensure the service schedule on timely manner.
Onsite	Should support the customer in the proper manner..Ur service staff is not trianed..the service engineer who had come to solve the problem,has damaged my lappy..I have complained also but no one has taken any action
Carry In / Walk - In	No more updates for Vibe P1
Depot	My laptop was returned to me damaged. It was obviously dropped by your technician and not reported to me. I called support upon receiving my damaged laptop and was told to return it for repair. I find that totally unacceptable! The laptop has a major dent on the lower corner and the upper corner of the screen is also damaged as you can see by the pixels. I have photos showing the damage (both before and after). To repair the laptop doesnt resolve any issues that can result from being dropped. I expect nothing less than a full replacement of a new laptop. The original issue of battery life was improved but not corrected. Furthermore, the laptop was received back to me still in administrative settings, so I could not log in.
Onsite	Had to wait a long time for the replacement parts.  Make them readily available for known, chronic issues.
Contact Center	Give the operators better quality headset microphones to improve understandability. Other than that, the technician was extremely knowledgeable and helpful.
Depot	Since I was within warranty and the problem lasted very long, I should have really been given a replacement in the meantime to last until the laptop was returned to me.
Contact Center	Read the survey response and contact the customer
Depot	Faster turnaround time, unit needed to be sent to Germany which made the process quite slow.
Contact Center	The website is frustrating to navigate -- once or twice I had to start again from the beginning after making an error.Also the only advice available for how to find my serial number, both on the website and on the phone support, was to find it on the underside of my device. However, that information is in extremely small font, and in grey on silver -- basically impossible for me to read without my reading glasses. At no point was I told that I can find my serial number in the System Information app on my device. I only learned that later.
Onsite	replacement part being delayed and delayed more than 1 month
Depot	Check your carrier... never received notification that the laptop was on its way back to us, and it was actually delivered to a house 6 streets away from mine totally different house address. The person who received my package luckily came to my house and gave it to us.  problems with your delivery service and delivery notifications as well. Other than that all was great.
Depot	Take less that 8 weeks to return a laptop.  Keep me informed of the process at a bare minimum.
Depot	Fix my PC not return it with the same fault.
Contact Center	Let us book this in on an online portal and provide a reference number and repairer address so that we can have this booked in and sent out within an hour and not have to wait several days for all backs and connote tickets as we can pay for our own courier
Contact Center	Nobody has even contacted me to arrange a repair! Case was closed without my consent even though I mentioned specifically that I wanted to know if the case was being closed
Onsite	Have better descriptions of why parts are on back order.
Onsite	Improve the computers and the parts so that they don't break/malfunction 20 minutes out of the box and when you send a tech and they break the computer, fix it right away and let the client (me) know if you're going to cancel their ticket because it's rude and upsetting and takes more time on everyone's part for me to have to open a whole new ticket.
Depot	Computer was returned in an unusable state.
Onsite	Better ticketing system for status updates, changes of contact info, etc. i don't want to play phone tag.
Carry In / Walk - In	Problem resolution get after 10 days
Depot	FYI second part of address doesn't show up on your shipping labels.  EVERY TIME i send a PC in for repair I have FedEx calling complaining about address and not having our suite number when ALL of the info is provided on the Lenovo Support page.  I finally just added all address info to the main address line - should probably fix that one day...
Onsite	(1) Improve communications: your service operation routinely went silent during the process, acknowledging my messages but not providing meaningful responses about what came next.  One reasonably clear message up front assessing my issue and advising on the steps to resolve it would have eliminated several of my follow-up messages, as well as the duplicate case you opened in response to my first status request.(2) Improve communications: warn me that replacing my mainboard could affect my Windows license.  It took me several additional days to resolve that issue on my own before I could actually use my laptop again.  Had I known what to expect, I might have been able to better prepare.
Depot	Provide updates while device is being serviced and in transit.
Contact Center	Nobody ever contacted me
Depot	Fix my laptop I have sent it in 2 times now and every time lenovo claims it's fixes it but nothing changes. O will be putting in a formal complaint and letting other people know not to buy your products
Depot	free return with courier
Depot	My tablet was returned damaged and its new
Contact Center	Don't hide your phone numbers.  Don't have those who charge to help when there is guarantee in effect.  It appears you engage in a scam which will hurt your 'good will' that you may have invested to.  It took me forever to find the correct to the right number for my lap top.  Your printing your registration number and type of product.   If it were be able to read by a person who needs reading  glasses would be a new policy that the industry may have a conspiracy not to do.  I know your corporation is in Hong Kong but so is Mattel which was close to where I have lived near on El Segundo Blvd in Hawthorne CA.  Now corporations are no longer leaving our state because they are showing the location that is a high taxing, returns with quality workers and happy workers who are productive that pays them back..  The richest corporation is located in California.  Apple wit I phones.  In Manhattan Beach is the corporation of one of the newest and most popular shoe company in American.  By the way their corporation center is newly build on Sepulvida Blvd which is Pacific Highway before and after the South Bay cities.  Manhattan has the most houses sold over $1million than any other city in the state, which is in such a small number of square miles.  There is a bumper sticker that says "There is no life East of Sepulvida ".  Those houses sell from $5-$20millions and much more.
Onsite	Listen and document where to send part and onsite technician
Contact Center	I could not reach help through your help line, it kept disconnecting my call.  Please make that more user friendly.  The only way I could get help was by having a tech expert call ne
Depot	Update status on website not cause customer to have to call in for updates.
Onsite	The part I received is not a customer installable part. Most people do not have the star bit needed to remove the screws.  I also found that I knocked a wire loose trying to install the part. I had to resolder the wire. The weak contact of the wire may have been the problem all along.
Depot	Make sure you check everything out before returning device.
Agent	Not put me on hold
Contact Center	First of all the problem was not correct it over the phone. Your service tech accuse me of intentionally damaging the computer I bought. There's absolutely no reason why I would buy something and then damage it. The unit was supposed to be returned to me via u.s. mail and it's not. Please let me know where it is and when I get it back fixed
Depot	Shorter wait times.make clear that you need to call to get repair so I don't waste time on the website.better web information, and communicaiton in general
Onsite	Lenovo can make arrangements with the technician on parts before arrival
Contact Center	Would prefer a technician support rather than through phone/chat
Carry In / Walk - In	First tell me. What is the use of customers to provide a rating or feedback here or directly to manager in the branch itself. If customers are not getting a proper customer service through a 2 worst and angry customer support representative who is sitting in Jayanagar, Bangalore branch. Not only I got a bad service. There are lot of customers who got a bad service especially from those 2 girls. If you want to know check Google reviews. You people will come to know. I know this is waste of and of no use. Then also I have 1 % hope. So I'm writing. Thank you.
Onsite	Try to maintain your database updated with products warranty
Depot	There was still an issue with the product when it was returned that was not in the original problem. Customer service was horrible at offering additional help on this new issue.
Onsite	For Improvement of Experience you should mention your Service Center name on web site as it is not updated well
Onsite	Please give outsource vendor the full knowledge of how to troubleshoot of any lenovo product.
Contact Center	Make sure staff are more knowledgeable and able to provide correct information and resolutions on first contact.
Onsite	Connect your customer service to support to update information and trouble shoot issues that I have described. Go the extra mile and save yourself some money on what is clearly a network or software issue vs a hardware issue involving a tech.  Have your customer service armed with the ability to access knowledge bases or at least GOOGLE search the issue. Which I have done.
Carry In / Walk - In	My Motorola G4 Plus 64GB phone was originally returned because of a defective screen (,ghost touches).  The replacement phone failed within weeks, unable to be charged, and was returned for yet another replacement phone.  The second replacement phone that was sent was not a "...new or like-new phone" as promised by the Customer Service rep.  This replacement phone was obviously a repaired phone, as the battery has several scratches on it, and the outer bezel of the phone is cracked at the bottom, next to the USB charging port.  I am NOT happy with the Motorola Customer Service and the phone that was sent as a replacement.  My original phone was in perfect cosmetic condition when it was returned for the faulty screen.  I was always extremely careful with my phone, to keep it in perfect condition. Both phones that Motorola sent as replacements were refurbished, previously-owned phones that were not what I was promised.  The fact that I am now on my third G4 Plus, and it arrived with evidence of physical damage is unacceptable.  Unless Motorola addresses this situation to my satisfaction, I will not be purchasing another Motorola product. Craig Willis  314-862-0031
Depot	after return of product, product still doesn't function optimally
Depot	i said specifically the computer is running super slow and they should wipe it or fix it and they didnt touch it. all they did was fix the usb port which was another issue . .
Depot	After 2 weeks at Depot service the laptop was returned and the battery would not hold a charge.  Thus, the computer was unusable, and we needed to bring it to a local Lenovo repair partner, Microcenter.  In my opinion, that is unacceptable.
Onsite	It took a while for the parts to arrive but was informed on the delay
Onsite	Fix the tepair cycle for parts.  Only one part was back ordered yet the entire order was held.  It should not take 3 weeks to repair a laptop
Carry In / Walk - In	Unprofessional behavior, Not on time delivery, Uncooperative behavior.Went for four times for service event still unsatisfied.
Onsite	Neater when placing & finishing the parts back
CRU	When a customer goes to the expense of returning a faulty item to Lenovo registered post and goes to great lengths to explain where the replacement part should be returned, and is subsequently ignored and sending the part to the wrong address. This still leaves the me/customer with a non functional laptop then this is not great customer support in my opinion and falls short of my expectations especially after spending so much on a top of the range Lenovo laptop.
Depot	The times we have to call to have the unit sent to my child university instead of our home were exhausting. We were told to call before shipping the unit to you, after you received the unit, and before you returned the unit. Why couldn't your customer service take down the information at the time of the return request? Your could guess the result: the unit was shipped to the wrong address.
Onsite	Respond faster by getting the part and contacting me sooner
Onsite	More communication/troubleshooting suggestions prior to telling us it needs a part. What part? What can I do in the meantime to try and fix it myself?
Depot	The issue was intermittent, laptop was returned before the issue had time to occur.
Carry In / Walk - In	Repaired several times very disappointed always going down the service centre to repair no compensation made money was deducted from prepaid account for almost $100.
Onsite	Spare part on-stock
Onsite	The initial assistance on the chat to install updated drivers etc was not specific to my hardware problem.  Although it was probably good for me to apply these, it delayed me getting the new part ordered for half a day until I applied them all and then contacted support again.
CRU	The tech had to return 3 times, because  the first systemboard was defective and the second time the parts sent were not for this machine.
Depot	Be honest about repair times and service. Follow through with what customer service reps say they will do.
Depot	You could provide free shipping to and from the depot and at least a 90 day service warranty for previous or returning customers on new purchases
Contact Center	Reduce the wait time on the support line
Contact Center	Answer the phones quicker. Give better options - e.g. the person I spoke told me the steps I had to take to resolve the issue. These were longwinded and included a step to take it back to factory settings.  No thanks.  Not very pleased at all. I've had this one month and it's slow and I'm not at all happy with my purchase!
Onsite	i was unable to track the parts delivery based on the link you have provided so was not able to coordinate my joint visit. also the login to the managed... website is not straightforward using the intuitive way of following the lenovo web and links it took me to a different portal where i was not able to login with just recently registered login and password details. had to phone it in the end. the engineer fixed it day1 so no complants, good job!
Contact Center	still waiting for answer
Contact Center	reduce waite time
Carry In / Walk - In	Ensure the problem is solved before returning it to us.
Onsite	We spoke to your call centre, Rajesh - who is the Team Leader is extremely unprofessional and not empathetic with our issue at all  he was speaking as though he has woken up from Bed and in an extremely rude and sarcastic tone. No support whatsoever.
Depot	update the customer about the process.
Carry In / Walk - In	The charger wire I got in return is of cheap quality then the original one.No service center at my district, cost me Rs. 500 to reach at your center and got a wire of Rs. 200-250/- with a day waste of of the company worst policy of generating IMEI from mobile even while having bill.Shitty serviceWill opt. MI from next purchase
Depot	Send the shipping label / contact me when the wrong email address was put in by your team.
Contact Center	The phone person told me to go to Geek Squad and said he'd follow up with me the next day. Geek Squad suggested sending the unit to Lenovo for service to Lenovo. Technician did not call back to follow up as indicated.
Onsite	Mend the machine..... had a guy come three times and the machines still don't work.... they now need re-imaging and have to go else where for it.... Also if the technician checked the machine before he went then he would realize he had the wrong parts and what he did didn't help!
Contact Center	Have better staff trained to deal with issues,show respect to the customer and call them abck, not ignore thier calls or cut them off after waiting for half hour
Onsite	Defective on arrival the parts that need to be replaced
Onsite	A tech came a new motherboard for y pc and discovered that it was the monitor that was defective instead.  He informed the Lenovo warrantee dept. that he was not installing the motherboard and a new monitor should be sent instead (Case # 405HN79).  To date we have not been contacted about the replacement monitor and no one knows what we are taking about when we call about the matter.  Everyone passes the ticket to someone else.  I need the monitor now.  It is just as important as a functioning motherboard. Over the years, I have purchased over 15 pcs from the Lenovo website and outlet. I will not buy or recommend another Lenovo product unless this is taken care of immediately.
Carry In / Walk - In	i got a defective mobile from company, when go to service centre for repairing ,they repair my mobile 3 times, but still i m getting the same issue (problem) in my mobile.so now i ll go for the consumer care , and registered complaint against this
Carry In / Walk - In	Staffs are not professional
Depot	better online interface to track and report issues, take a long time
Contact Center	Reduce wait time
Onsite	Improve diagnosis and repair times
Contact Center	Reduce wait time from initial call
Carry In / Walk - In	I received a replacement Droid Turbo 2 less than a month ago, I unintentionally got the screen wet a bit and the display stopped working, I do get some sound from the phone once in a while,I was hoping I could replace or purchase another Droid Turbo 2 because I like the cell phone over the newer ones, The agent on the telephone line said no.Can I buy a Droid Turbo 2 from you?Please
Contact Center	Of late, the device keeps freezing and switching off.  The Charging cable doesn't connect easily, unless I manipulate and support it or position the Device in a certain way. It takes ages to charge fully.
Onsite	Tech had to wait for parts to be shipped to him. Tech should probably have access to inventory
Carry In / Walk - In	Within 7 months ago I have Been to service centre For 3 times still My phone problems are not fixed
Onsite	Speed of part delivery
Depot	When I contacted Lenovo to change my shipping address, they sent my Lenovo to my original address and not the updated one. That was VERY inconvenient.
Contact Center	Better accountability, better customer service, faster service, basically everything you can think of can be improved dramatically.
Depot	inform people when you return items.
Depot	Make a better product laptop returned to best buy
Onsite	Fix the update issue
Onsite	Improve partsengineer sheduling
Onsite	keep update
Contact Center	Listen more and release updates for their tablets
Contact Center	Not wait for the onsite repair to come. Im a college student and doing class work with no computer is extremely hard as my laptop is vital to doing some activities for class
Depot	I can't think of anything that can improve on what you are already providing, the service that I have received has been exceptional.
Depot	Provide better status updates. The website never had any other than the receive date. Had to keep calling.
Depot	Make repairs faster as people depend on their computers for their education, jobs and general life
Contact Center	hard to find your contact number, Lenovo website indicate wrong contact number.
Depot	Have a better return program where you overnight a shipping box.  I had to wait for a new laptop that I had ordered online to arrive and use that box to safely return the computer.  When you consider this was a $1000 laptop, absorbing that cost is reasonable for such a new computer to fail.  I have purchased $20k in Lenovo laptops for my family and employees and would have expected better customer service for a month old laptop failure.
Depot	After your Memphis shop restored my laptop I was unable to open Windows after I received it. I called your customer service number and the man was unable to restore it after he had me go to the web site that let him take control So you sent me a thumb drive recovery media, which after several phone conversations we were able to have success.
Onsite	Hire professionals
Onsite	Took two weeks for the parts
Depot	Fix all the issues on the product before returning it
Depot	My machine died after installing a Lenovo update ? Bit disappointed with that
Contact Center	Still waiting for the hinges on my laptop to be fixed. I've been told this is something that happens to lots of Lenovo laptops. In the future don't use inferior parts on an expensive laptop
Carry In / Walk - In	I received a defect product in the original box. and it  should have given the customer 100% new one replacement. However instead of replacement, I waited more than two weeks just for " reparing" the whole new laptop.
Onsite	wrong part issued - nneded a power supply, not a main board.
Carry In / Walk - In	It's because of the unprofessional attitude of some staff at the service center. They simply don't care about customer's valuable time. Mostly busy on the phone away from desk and customer has no other way but to keep waiting for them to come back to desk and respond to queries. Very very unprofessional.. please check.
Onsite	Keep up with the local service support that came to our house.
Contact Center	1. make it easier for first time customers looking for the support contact details on the website. 2. the lenovo staff should review the case before coming on the line because the customer has already inputted the case number at the start of the call so that the customer does not need to keep repeating the case number
Depot	Making updates to the ticket as promised and indicated. Your product is great but customer service could be better on the updating side, especially if the customer is to use that ticket number to see the progress of the repair and estimation of when it will be completed and shipped back for security reasons, meaning that computer doesn't stolen from home prior to returning home.
Contact Center	awaitng additional information
Carry In / Walk - In	Take feedback on phone/ email and feed to one pt.
Contact Center	make the call center 24x7. 9-5 for 5 days is no good
Onsite	There has been a reoccurence.
Contact Center	Quit responses
Onsite	it was a total run around of service, and passing off to other departments.....rude employees on the phone...and promises that were never kept
Depot	Improve the speed and communication on the return service. The repair took 2 weeks from collection to return, but from the online tracking, it only took 3 days to repair, after taking 5 days to arrive. It then sat waiting to be shipped out for a further 5 days, after which it only took 1 day to be delivered back. Why would the shipping take so much longer in one direction? And why the delay from repair to return? I wouldn't mind the time so much if there were more frequent updates.
Carry In / Walk - In	Handset isn't behaving properly inspite of three times repair from authorized service center
Onsite	Honour the Next Busines Day service we pay for and not give excuses about waiting on parts. You never seem to hold parts.
Depot	I have to visit twice and still touch pad issue is not resolved niter did i got update which suppose to happen 2 weeks back.
Contact Center	Be more informative they had my laptop for 36 days and I had to make numerous calls to find out the status of the repair of my laptop
Carry In / Walk - In	Speed of resolution of the problem.
Onsite	Just Provide training to upgrade the technical expertise of lenovo technical support staff.
Depot	Make a product that doesn't have to go back and forth for repairs 3+ times within 6 months times.  Customer service rep was very professional and helpful to resolve the problem.  Many thanks to her.  Was able to make an exchange with her help and knowledge.
Onsite	please arrange parts at the earliest
Onsite	Ensure the phone support understands the parts of a machine a bit better. That way next time when AUX Fan 2 is dying, they dont send a CPU fan, front fan and then finally the AUX fan. Wasnt the most fun pulling the PC three times out of production.
Onsite	keep parts in your stock
Depot	Timeframe - was supposed to be next business day, but at first they said they had the part, then that they were waiting for the part, then that they had the part again. So wasn't sure if it was a system error or what.
Depot	Just with better communication on returning the product.
Contact Center	improve your customer services so repairs are carried out in the appropriate time and not make it so difficult to have a call logged and processed
Contact Center	No one has responded to two requests and it's just states completed
Onsite	Identify the exact problem and Timely resolution
Onsite	Engineers should be more efficient in their work.. as when they fixed my LCD screen the glue residue is still visible. Which is actually a very distubing image.
Contact Center	my request has not been responded to
Depot	Maybe faster repair service. The repair took about a week and a half longer than expected, but the turnaround time was still not bad at all, and everything else was perfect.
Carry In / Walk - In	Phone updated by service center but votle not available for calling
Depot	Test all parts before shipping
Onsite	Improve punctuality of your on-site support and provide more trainings to your  customer supports.
Contact Center	Clearer phone connections. Agent sounded like she was talking into a tin can.
Onsite	System warranty data was not updated as per shared purchase invoice so As per the our invoice system was in warranty but when we logged the ticket with support desk for another system we got the reply that system is not under warranty and even after sharing the invoice copy we have not got the support on the same.
Depot	Fix the website page that tells you the update of your service and WHEN IT WAS SHIPPED BACK  to the customer.  If I had that, I wouldn't have had to make a bunch of phone calls.   Inform people that they have to ship it back in their own box.  I was unclear from the service agent that I had to supply the box. He told me Lenovo would send the right box.  But I could have misunderstood him as he had an accent and was talking VERY fast.  Train your foreign speaking agents to speak more slowly.
Contact Center	Not much it took a couple of transfers to get to the right person to help me however since I wasn't sure what the exact problem was it was ok. Thanks for the support and I have my tablet back
Carry In / Walk - In	Please improve your service center's attention to customers in regards to follow-ups (progress updates), and service timeframe. My experience with the Lenovo Service Center in Plaza Berjaya was terrible as I had to make double trips there to follow-up on the progress of my device's repairs, BECAUSE the service center blatantly refused to pick up the office phone over the span of 2 weeks. When I arrived at the Lenovo Service Center in Plaza Berjaya to inquire their reason for the lack of updates, the front desk who is also the technician said that the entire office was on annual leave and that the landline was taken with them during their annual leave days. How could anyone be expected to believe that? Also because the technician said the office was opened during the 2 weeks, then proceeds to lie about the office being away, it simply does not make sense! The repairs for my device also took approximately 3 weeks causing me undue stress as I was promised that it would be repaired by the 10th day, only to have my calls unanswered with NO UPDATES AT ALL! I sincerely hope that Lenovo would please take the necessary action to improve the support services at that particular branch as the staff there seem to be absolutely lacklustre and apathetic.
Contact Center	Wanted to charge me a ridiculous amount of money for something they werent even sure was the issue
Contact Center	Still waiting for notification of the part and to be contacted by the next support person regarding the part
Onsite	Make sure that you ship out the right part the first time.
Contact Center	Shorter wait times.
Onsite	Better job of providing working replacement parts
Onsite	Timely supply of parts
Onsite	Have spare parts in your inventory
Depot	It was returned with a different issue and is unresolved. They sent it back but the touchpad mouse does not function. It was working before.
Contact Center	I had some difficulty understanding my rep's accent, and it took 45 minutes on the phone for him to fix my Lenovo Battery Gage display. On the positive side, I got to talk with him quickly and he indeed fixed my problem. A score of 8 is very good.  Thank you.  PS - this was my second time calling.  The first time it took way too long to get a call back, which I don't know if I ever did.
Carry In / Walk - In	I received a replacement phone quicker than expected. The new phone wont recognize my SIM card without a slip of paper behind it pressing it into the phone contacts. Overall, I have become very disappointed with this line of Motorola product and will think twice  about buying another.
Contact Center	i do have a hearing problem, but this call was especially difficult for me because of the strong accent of the person helping me.  i frequently had to ask her to repeat what she said.
Onsite	Well the issue still has not been resolved - waiting on parts.  The rep who came onsite was fantastic but didn't have all the needed parts
Depot	update their check report status
Onsite	The service team is not able to receive the correct part from lenovo
Onsite	Speed up part delivery.  6 weeks is awful
Depot	Some info about what fault is and when its expected to be returned
Onsite	Stand behind your product---if the repair doesn't work--instead of having us jump through hoops, just follow up and work on a resolution or a replacement.
Onsite	Like i said, more spare parts. Now only spare part was motherboard, but the problem was with ram memory.
Contact Center	Faster customer service response
Onsite	Faster turn-around time in the replacement of parts will greatly improve the service
Onsite	Not replace one part at a time over 2 weeks
Depot	Previously stated - speed up the delivery of parts to complete repair.  I understand that we are in Hawaii.  But the process can be reduced to 2 or 3 days, instead of a week.
CRU	Provide me with information as to how i am supposed to replace the battery - No instructions or communications at all.  I am not prepared to open the laptop, just to have your tech to tell me that now the notebook is out of warranty because I opened it.  There is a reason I purchased an ON-Site Warranty.
Onsite	Better Communication by Responding back with updates
Depot	Timely updates. I waited almost 2 months. If I had not called you guys after waiting 1 month, nothing would've been done because my laptop was ignored and forgotten about.
Onsite	improve the communication service as only you can call the customer if customer wants to call or talk to the concerned department he can't do that as no contact no is available
Onsite	The length of time taken for request to be raised, parts ordered, parts received is way too long.
Contact Center	Quit automatically closing an open case.  Follow through in any way to resolve the problem.  Quite possibly the worst customer service I've every experienced.
Onsite	Better part QC
Onsite	Replace my laptop its been repaired too many times.
Onsite	Communication was very poor, first with me re: what I should expect and second between the parts people and the onsite tech. 1) I first spoke with a customer service rep who said they'd send a tech out to install a new battery as per my company's contract. 2) Then I was contacted by the tech who would be coming to do the installation. He asked if the battery had arrived yet. I didn't realize the battery would be coming separately (e.g., that the tech wouldn't bring it). 3) The tech spent a week texting me to see if the battery had arrived (it hadn't), I asked if he could check the holdup and he said no, that's not what he does, it's a different division or something.4) I called the support line again and was given a tracking number for the package with the battery. After a few days I checked that tracking number and it showed that the package was never shipped. 5) I called again to and was told the battery was out of stock. I asked to be notified via email when the battery shipped so I could look out for it. 6) A package showed up at my apartment with no prior notice. I opened the box and found a very small device. I took a photo of the device and sent it to the tech to say the battery had arrived.7) Tech responded saying that wasn't the battery and to let him know when I got another package. 8) Waited a few more days and another box arrived with a larger device. Took a photo of that, texted it to the tech and he said Yes, that's the battery. We arranged a time for him to come by9) Tech arrived, installed the new battery. Took the other small device that was shipped, left the old battery10) Yesterday another box arrived with another copy of the small device I was sent the first time. I have no idea what to do with it. The issue was resolved on the first attempt if you count the first attempt as the time the tech showed up to install the battery. But it took lots of back and forth on my part, and there was never a good answer from customer support on when things were shipping and when I'd get a part. Very chaotic.
Carry In / Walk - In	Improve product quality... had repaired 2 times in 1 year...2nd time in couple of months time
Carry In / Walk - In	give fast response to customer, be more supportive, improve your technical team
Onsite	better co-ordination of ordering for parts and field service
Onsite	Response time was terrible, no updates to the service delay were provided and the technician sent was clueless
Carry In / Walk - In	My Moto G 4 Play was given for replacing the display, but returned with a broken power button and the store manager the arrogant and simply denied further support, it is quite sure that was broken while it was taken out from the previous screen as they comes integrated
CRU	When sending Customer Replaceable parts, it would be nice if you would send instructions on how to replace that item.  I have a Service Maintenance Manual, so I was able to find the instructions.  If you don't send instructions, sending a link for that information might suffice, except if the user only has the one device, it may make it hard for them to get to that link.
Depot	Fully test the computer before returning.
Onsite	Don't let the part sit waiting at the UPS dropoff for 24 hours prior to letting the technician install it.  He wasn't even notified even though I called the Atlanta support center 4 times.
Onsite	Please improve your team who dispatches the spare parts. They are also refurbished & faulty
Contact Center	Improve the phone automation
Onsite	Listen to what the IT department from the businesses are stating what the issue is so that the correct part is sent and not the wrong one because of a scripting that the CSR is reading from.
Onsite	too many individual departments. it is very confusing to find the right department to report the issue or find support.
CRU	I was given instructions to "try" but they did not work or actually were already implemented in the BIOS. I was advised to call back and have the issue escalated to the network team.
Carry In / Walk - In	My device have problem of low voice in receiver before service after service overall volume of device decrease.
Depot	I am not confident what was bought as a new machine will meet my expectations for longevity, too many critical parts have been replaced with poor workmanship exhibited on multiple occasions
Contact Center	Faster telephone response.
Depot	One of my laptops not returned yet .  The laptop that was returned is still not working peoperly
Depot	Not send the unit back with a broken power switch and no power cords
Contact Center	It took 2 transfers to get where I needed to be.  The phone connection was very poor and staticky, difficult to hear.
Onsite	I was referred to website to download and create a boot drive but that could not install Windows.  Your service man also came with flash drive and installed Windows but that also do not work.
Contact Center	Better phone connection, but most likely that is beyond your control.
Onsite	ensure that the replacement parts are QC check before being sent
Depot	Returned unit with same issue
Onsite	I never got the service and no one has came! You guys wore suppose to call me to confirm a time and date!
Contact Center	I was disappointed at the response from Lenovo. The person whom I spoke to really offered no help, just send the laptop back to Lenovo in Sydney. I mentioned the problem to one of my sons, he suggested taking the battery out wiping it and replacing it. Alas it worked. Lenovo could have asked me to try something. So the problem wsa not resolved by Lenovo
Contact Center	Follow up call after beyond 1 week please
Onsite	Giving free antivirus and lesser updates
Carry In / Walk - In	A little bit faster work I expect and keep me updated.
Onsite	availability of spare partsdirect chat availability even outside of office hours
Onsite	threw service provide on time
Onsite	Give the engineer the correct spare part in the first place.
Depot	Not return the vomputer scratched up
Depot	Not have the laptop for 22 business days from the time you received it to the time I got it back.  The repair status site is a joke, one told me ticket was created and when the laptop was returned no other notes were given. Every time I went on chat or called  I was told that someone would be calling me about how long it was taking, still waiting for that phone call. Only part was a wire between LCD and Motherboard. This is what I told the chat person in the first place. I know to change that wire only takes about most 2 hours start to finish. I worked for a computer manufacturer and had to repair this with the laptops we had.
Depot	still can't reinstall windows or update
Carry In / Walk - In	Phone returned with the same problem.And you charged me $139.This is very disappointing
Depot	completely test the laptop before returning it to me.
Depot	Please, complete your repairs faster. I was waiting for around 5 weeks (close to 35 days) for my damage repairs to be completed under my 4-year accidental damage warranty protection plan, all because certain new parts were not correctly inventoried in the system for the technicians to order, and only the engineers could do it. To receive information of this sort, I had to jump through hoops and call the regular customer service number (that is what I will be rating on a subsequent page) to find what the repair centre number was. This allowed me to call them every day, per their recommendation, to receive status updates that were not logged in the webtool flex website. It took far too long for what I thought would be a simple fix before college courses started back up this summer again, and I had to receive a loaner Thinkpad tablet for the first half of the semester that did not work very well. I'm not at all satisfied with this case, but it eventually worked out in the end.
Contact Center	Clearer microphones or clearer speech
Contact Center	By stopping the auto cut off, after a set time on the telephone to you whilst trying to fix problem, very frustrating!
Contact Center	The only reason I gave this process a 5 is because some of your reps were extremely rude, one guy in Atlanta told me that he could not help me and hung up, when I called back I got the same rep and he didn't even want to hear what I needed, he just transferred me to premium support. Your customer service people in the Phillipines were great as were your sales reps in NC. But with that said, when I needed some technical info as to why the laptop wasn't set up to do certain things (e.g. like being TRIM enabled) and how to get certain functions to work, none of the techs could not help me at all. All of these questions were very basic, the reason I know this is because I have another Lenovo laptop, and it came from you just the way I needed it, this one however was not set up that way and knowone would/could help me. I wasted 6 hours with Sales, Tech and customer support who told me I had to pay for the information I needed (they said they had the answers, but I had to pay for it) even though my last Laptop had been set up the way I needed it to be...so I know it could be done.
Contact Center	When you ring you need to be able to clearly explain what the problem is the person spoke very poor English I then tried to call them back and could not greet through we ended up communicating by email which was slow and time consuming.
Depot	Test products prior to shippingKeep stock of parts for repair
Onsite	Better quality control on your parts.  Service tech was terrific but had to make multiple visits due to inferior parts.
Onsite	pls deliver the required spare material on time.
Depot	Keep track of your customers information better, so I don't have to give the same information each time I call.
Onsite	Have more information for me when I call and better email updates. Technician was great. The uncertainty was before he called.
Onsite	Meet your contractual obligations and give us THE PURCHASERS OF YOUR PRODUCTS proper feedback when requested
Contact Center	At least better service for recall please. Look at Samsung during note 7 saga.
Onsite	Implement communication around progress of the support query, reply to queries posted to support portal, act more promptly to order parts
Onsite	Pay more attention to sending out the right color parts to the technicians.
Onsite	Do more than just replace the faulty part....there were other issues that had to be resolved by a separate engineer.
Onsite	Technician could not resolve the problem with the part shipped so we had to ship computer to you.
Onsite	Reach on time..it got delayed by 2 days.
Depot	Provide more updates to the customer without having to call customer care every single time. The online ticket status should be updated regularly with the current status of repair. Also repair time is way too long even though for my case they couldn't replicate the issue and hence did not do any repairs, still I was without my laptop for 37 days!
Onsite	We understand that there is a 3 year on-site service warranty. No one came to check the device at site. The on-site service also mentions that if the repairs cannot be done at site, the engineer would take the device to the service center and get it repaired. None of this happened. Fake promises.
Depot	The customer support person who I was dealing with made multiple mistakes costing me a lot of personal time while I was on vacation. She firstly made the mistake of documenting the wrong problem with my laptop entirely and so it was returned to me still broken. The she denied making the mistake. Then she didn't book the courier twice leaving me to sit at home for two days on my vacation waiting for the courier. Then the laptop went missing in transit leaving me to spend half a day calling 5 different companies to try and find someone who knew some information and only arrived at the delivery address the day before I left the vacation. Very unhappy
Depot	Keep me updated on the state of my product when I send it in for repairs and give more details on what was done in repairs. It took an entire semester for my laptop to be repaired and I sent it in twice. Both times returned, there were malfunctions and damages that were not there before.  In the end, I'm still unsure what the was done to my laptop that required the time it took to repair to get it to a moderately functional condition.
Depot	Better repair times
Depot	Problem not resolved and tablet returned in ENVEN WORSE condition!
Onsite	Give the telephone support client services reps more access to information and timing on parts/technician contact
Depot	improve on times that parts will arrive for repairs. The repair company was ready to do the work, just lacked the parts to do so as they had to wait for them to be sent out.
Onsite	Came with wrong part
Onsite	good+spare parts delay
Onsite	Ship times for parts are way too long. My laptop has been non functional for almost three months. Problem still persists and no resolution date has been given or updates regarding part ship times, tech arrival estimates, and how much longer to expect my laptop to be down.
Onsite	Keep drivers updated
Depot	To make repair faster bcoz it is little bit longer
Depot	Don't lose my device, keep me updated on status changes
Onsite	2 days waiting part
Contact Center	Waiting times on phone
Carry In / Walk - In	Went to exchange charger cable but in return they are telling that my display and earphones jack is not working. So they can't give me a new cable unless everything works properly. I am still under warranty. But the store people are trying to create a new problem which does not exist and make money out of it.
Onsite	Have more parts in stock
Onsite	Keep parts in stock for next day to meet onsite service expectation.
Contact Center	I found that if you were on the phone for a certain period of time you went to survey and had to redial and at one-time the advisor was cut off and i went to survey it was very frustrating
Onsite	Lenovo can first start by having a better customer service option aside from just a phone call to some random person who in turn cannot do anything other than follow a line and block chart to see what parts MIGHT be needed, then schedule, again a random service tech that might be able to contact you within 2 or 3 weeks. Customer Service is first and foremost number 1. Right out of the block Lenovo missed the the mark.
Depot	pay for returns
Onsite	Solve issues on time
Contact Center	Stop providing updates which corrupt your own machines. Take responsibility once you have wrecked customer computers, and fix them.
Carry In / Walk - In	Provide more regular progress update. E.g. weekly.
Onsite	after replacing new HDD my machine working fine  Kindly collect faulty part as soon as possible !
Onsite	If you are going to selll a next-day service upgrade, then you had better ensure you have the parts and technicians to support it.  This entire experience was miserable, taking 20 days to repair from when I first opened the request.
Depot	laptop was returned to me Sept 10th and the keyboard stopped working Sept 18th
Carry In / Walk - In	As the Network issue still same, the service center updated my phone software but no resolved
Onsite	Faster response, particularly if the initial replacement part is faulty.
Depot	A bit faster - My PC was under repair for 2 weeks.
Depot	Better tracking and customer service, when I call actually know where my product is. When someone tells you they will follow up make sure they follow up. Don't tell me you can't find my product. It took almost a month to get my laptop back.
Depot	Well first learn how to fix them these is the second time I send it and I have the problem very bad service.
Depot	Laptop sent back has same error and malfunction
Contact Center	problem not reolved on call but I was able later to solve as your technician pointed me in the correct direction.
Onsite	better internal communication and scheduling of part shipments and tech appointments.
Onsite	Have a better constructed product With spare parts readily available.
Carry In / Walk - In	Sometimes its hang too much.. And it automatically updated even I turn of auto update
Depot	The return packaging shipping was absolutely horrible.  I came very close to sending it back to you because there is now a scratch on our monitor screen and I can hear something loose inside the monitor.  If I did not need the computer so desperately I would have returned it to Lenovo.
Onsite	Timely updates to be provided so that customer knows the real situation.
Carry In / Walk - In	bring software updates
Carry In / Walk - In	I feel the charge to receive the phone in advance of sending the defective phone in is a gouge. Also, after calling and giving all required information I didn't receive a replacement, so after several days I called to check the status and was informed my credit card info didn't go through so it was never processed.  I was not informed of this by Motorola until I reached out which I feel was a big oversight on motorola
Onsite	There was no status update on my request until I called the hotline. Once I did that everything was completed very quickly leading me to believe that the service request was never actioned until I called.
Onsite	turn over repair faster.
Onsite	engineer told me that part is damage but i cant see any damage
Onsite	I had no issues at all with Lenovo, but my internal technical support team was extremely slow in responding and helping which was why it took so long.  Todd, your service technician, was fantastic,personable, timely, and has excellent follow up skills.
Contact Center	Better knowledge and response.
Carry In / Walk - In	The reason the original phone broke was due to an update. Since this was in no way my fault I should not have had to pay anything to have it fixed.
Onsite	Make sure to communicate regularly with updates and send working replacement parts.
Onsite	Improve part availability, parts are more often than not backordered
Carry In / Walk - In	first time part delivered was faulty
Onsite	Quicker resolution for a brand new laptop. I spent $4000 for a complete brand new laptop that didnt work properly from day 1. After 2 onsite visits the problem could not be fixed. Three weeks have passed and I still do not have a new working laptop. Laptop is now being shipped back to Lenovo. Lenovo didnt offer a replacement during this time. Very unsatisfied with the length of time its taking to resolve the Lenovo issue.
Onsite	Tech's phone number for the parts shipment and not mine.
Onsite	Improving laptop quality (this is the third issue I have needed onsite help with)Improving the quality of repair service. The website has removed the option to request callbacks meaning I need to go through the normal call center system to connect with anyone (even though I purchased the extended warranty), and then need to repeat the specifics of my case each time. Further the box I am supposed to ship my laptop out for further repair has not arrived one week after my request,
Carry In / Walk - In	Engineer behavior too roud and management is very week, every customer has same problem, why I buy Lenovo & Moto handset. Please take online feedback & Review through email or Link then Lenovo must realised that what is doing in Lenovo service centre.
CRU	Let me know when they receive the broken part returned.
Carry In / Walk - In	New updates facing problem
Agent	Less time on hold, although it wasn't too bad. And I like the "call me" instead of waiting to get started.
Carry In / Walk - In	Instead of a proper resolution service centre just updated the phone saying now it will work fine. Problem still remains same for both of my phones
Onsite	It seems there was a slight confusion as to where the part shipped to.  The field tech assigned to our project didn't know where the part was shipped to, whether it was to us directly or to the Lenovo Center here in our location.  Possibly better coordination and logistics would do wonderfully.
Depot	The repair and replacement should be much faster.
Onsite	maybe provide basic troubleshooting knowledge base for users before users contact the call center so users can capture certain information required by call center.
Onsite	See the previous comment about the back order and lack of communications regarding WHEN the technician would be onsite (this is not a local technician issue, but rather Lenovo having mechanisms in place to provide better updates and expectations to the customer when something is back ordered).
Depot	Keep the customer updated on issues about there product.
Depot	Do what you say sending a unit back to the customer that doesn't work then leaving them hanging for weeks is unacceptable.
Contact Center	Provide owners a contact number for any future issues.
Onsite	Dear Yu Jie,  Thanks for your Mail. we got very poor Service from Your End, just for replace the part took more than a Two weeks. we got worst service from this time.
Onsite	Lenovo can send a correct and functioning part the first time.
Onsite	Enhance communication between parts service and the technicians
Contact Center	I'm not sure which phone call your survey is referring to because I had two calls very close in time. The first one was a suggestion to do a factory reset, which resulted in a new problem that I hadn't had before, and when I called about that problem, I was told to send in my tablet with no offer to reimburse for shipping. No thanks. I'm just going to buy a new tablet.
Contact Center	Less phone wait time
Depot	Have a clearer tracking system and report for the service of the product. I called to ask what the problem was and what they did to fix the computer and although the customer service rep was able to read the report, it was not the same in the returned packaging. I knew about the battery being replaced but not the motherboard.
Onsite	Improve communication of the process and ship the part correctly.
Onsite	Less problems sourcing parts. If they are in stock I would expect to receive them promptly, if they are out of stock I would expect to be told via email that the part is in stock and dispatched for either delivery to customer or ready to be picked up by service technician.
Carry In / Walk - In	Staffs are rude and are least bothered to update the status regarding the handset.. whenever called to check didn't respond properly.. problems still persists.. I'm hating this..
Depot	Cover what you say you're going to cover in the warranty. Don't return my computer and have it tell me the battery installed is not supported. Don't charge me for bogus problems.
CRU	Quicker delivery of part
Carry In / Walk - In	The speed with which I received a replacement phone. I put the non-working phone in the Federal Express box on Saturday when there was no pickup, and I received the new phone delivered by federal express the following Wednesday. The new phone is an exact replica of the non-functioning phone and works perfectly. So
Contact Center	I am waiting for a level 2 to call and escalate this issue
Depot	It is difficult when there is only one place you can send the unit to.
Onsite	When I pay for NBD on-site service, I expect NBD on-site service. Not for the part to come, and someone to show up 3 weeks later.
Contact Center	Options on initial phone menu are not clear for Yoga owners
Onsite	Actually try to fix the issue and talk to me instead of just sending a random part with a random tech
Depot	Do a better job at completing the repair claim in a faster manner. I was promised a turn around time of less than 2 weeks - unless the part was out of stock. It should not take 9 weeks to get a lenovo part back in stock. I was fortunate to get a loaner computer from my employer, but that is the exception to the rule. It is unconscionable that Lenovo had my laptop basically hijacked for this length of time. I couldn't have gotten the laptop returned without completing the defective part if I had wanted to. I was totally stuck waiting for Lenovo to get a part in at this slow pace. Also, the online status website did not offer an honest indication of why the work was not completed, or an expectation for when it would be complete. This is unsatisfactory in every way.
Onsite	speed up repair times, we have had many laptops which taken 3 weeks to repair
Contact Center	I spent a really long time before I could talk to someone.  I got ejected from the queue to 'message' with them.  Told i was 4th in Q, then 3rd in Q, then 2nd in Q, then 4TH IN Q!!!  Then got ejected. !!
Carry In / Walk - In	Waited ~ 3 weeks to receive the call to collect my laptop. During these 3 weeks, I was told initially that the SSD was faulty, but when I called to check on status, I was told the motherboard was the problem, then after replacing the motherboard, engineers found that it was still the SSD that was faulty. hence the wait for 3 weeks.So after waiting for 3 weeks, I received the call to collect and made a wasted trip to lenovo centre at bugis this monday. The new SSD is 128 GB in capacity while my original was 512 GB. Despite calling in 2 days later, I was not given an estimated date of return as of now and I'm still waiting for my laptop, it's been 4 weeks now.
Contact Center	Ensure the service staff should on starting of the conversation give the contact number of two levels up of superior officers and convey initially that in case you are not satisfied with my support, the costumer may contact the contact numbers offered of superior officers. And the superior officer should be of other department  only to adjudicate the problematic issues.
Contact Center	I have to call several times and my problem has not been fixed in nearly a year
Onsite	The technician had to come out a second time to fully resolve the issue due to the extensive faulty parts.
Onsite	A little faster turn around on parts
Contact Center	Make your telephone system a little more user-friendly.  Your people do fine, once you are able to talk to them.
Onsite	please provide your technicians a better knowledge they are extreamly shameless as far as i talk to a technician
Carry In / Walk - In	Test the equipments better before returning it to the client. I had to fix wi-fi by myself
Depot	Notify me when it's been sent back it purely by chance I was in to receive the laptoo
Depot	I had an issue with an automatic update causing my audio drivers to be disabled. I paid over $60 to have the computer properly packaged to ship back to Lenovo to be serviced. I use this computer for my business and was offered nothing to replace my business computer I use to ring up transactions. I had to purchase another computer just to have while Lenovo worked on my computer. When I did receive it back, it was not properly packaged. Nothing was used to hold the computer in place in the large box it was shipped back in. Not even a film protecting the computer screen. It was pressed against the side of the cardboard box with no protection and had clearly been bouncing around in the box. I paid to have it properly shipped so that it would not incur any damage and I was not shown the same respect. I called and waited for over 30 minutes to speak with someone about the issue. When I finally did get someone on the phone I was told to email. I have emailed twice now with no response back. This is incredibly unprofessional and if I do not receive correspondence regarding this issue I will take it to small claims court and tell everyone I know not to purchase Lenovo products.
Onsite	Please update your customer care toll free numbers in india.
Contact Center	Critical Updates were turned off on my PC to prevent BIOS updates from bricking my laptop. This does not resolve the issue.
Contact Center	Don't tell me to unplug my computer from its charger during a reset so the battery can die mid process. When the reset process is corrupted from the untimely shut down, don't tell me to go to the Geek Squad to get it fixed when they have no idea they have a working relationship with you. Don't send me a USB with a Windows 10 Pro on it but a product key for Windows 10 Home, which invalidates my Windows. Don't tell me you will expedite the sending of the replacement, and not actually overnight it until I call back 3 days later to ask where the USB is.
Depot	Return the machine in the 6 day return window as suggested, don't take more than 2 months. Fix the issue detailed, let alone introducing multiple other issues besides. I sent it in with one problem. I got it back with problems it didn't have to start with and the original problem is even worse, and it took more than 2 months to get it back. I want my warranty extended for not only the 2 months it was already in but for how ever long the new case 406wzr4 takes as well.
Contact Center	Ensure telephone representative are knowledgeable about warranty policies and can accurately explain them. Additionally, check phone lines periodically to ensure calls can be heard.
Contact Center	Shorter telephone prompts
Onsite	Should increase replacement stocks for common parts.
Onsite	If I request an onsite visit on a particular date, I don't expect an engineer to turn up at my door a month late and say I am being unreasonable in my time availability
Contact Center	We Don't have time for Troubleshoot all off thinks so kindly Send Your  Engineer Next time and Check the Laptop Physically .
Onsite	Wrong part was sent so original issue was not fixed - and the replacement part was also faulty and so tech booked for third visit today.
Onsite	Support very deley, providing wrong commitment to end user , require and genuine part not sending in one go.
Contact Center	read email and respond
Onsite	hardware replaced but not updated in bois till now.
Depot	when sending an email with instructions, ensure that the addressee receives that email   (instructions)
Onsite	when i got the Lenovo team in our office for fixing our Lenovo IDEAPAD 320S, and they did replacement of motherboard, but we found the new one of mother board is not the newest already, it looked like second one or eks from others used. we have some pics of them.
Onsite	By Improving service quality and the most important Timely resolution.
Contact Center	Quicker response on the customer service  phone line
Depot	Computer wasn't reset when returned to me but technician login and tools left on system. I had to do a reset in order to acces.
Contact Center	For some reason, phone connection was bad. Difficulty hearing.
Onsite	Problem resolve after technician replace parts
Onsite	Be more professional
Contact Center	Unacceptable delay in response. I am in China now ..not UK
Depot	Your e mail does not work, I sent several e mails for updates and none of them worked at all.  Very frustrating.
Onsite	Greater communication on status updates as once logged via web did't know what was happening and when
Contact Center	Cut down wait time on phone.
Carry In / Walk - In	I had first received a call from Motorola that they couldn't replace the phone I sent in due to it being older.  But then, when I asked if they could send something comparable, they said they would do that and ended up sending the same model. Thank you.
Contact Center	The issue could not be resolved over the phone or from your website. But it must be repaired or replaced
Onsite	Put my actual address on the parts box. Luckily Purolator called me and Luckily my client was 2 mins from the Purolator Depot!
Contact Center	I got off the phone and the screen went black again. A defective unit out of the box
Contact Center	Change your system our engineer in having to spend at least 45 mins each time he chases the case going over the existing information, keeps being told you have no record of the call.
Contact Center	There was a language barrier that made it very difficult to communicate and I was put on hold several times during the call with long pauses when the attendant was on the line.
Depot	Be clearer about the exect collection and return dates in the notification emails. Provide valid tracking info - currently lists a different courier (ups) to the one used (fedex) so the tracking number wasn't recognised on the carrier stated (though was valid with the actual carrier).
Onsite	To provide any kind of update without having to constantly chase to be given no realistic answer
Depot	Realize problems happen but after spending $2500 bucks on yoga 920 and having to go thru two system restores and the return process was very difficult. Started to second guess my purchase. Also very hard time communicating with technical dept. language barrier
Depot	Need to put more details in the courier post, i received a call from lenovo if i handed in my laptop days after i sent it.
Carry In / Walk - In	Hire professionals.
Onsite	Please speed up the part replacement process
Onsite	Send the correct parts the first time.
Depot	Not returning the box in a condition I would describe as "haphazard with a drop of apathy" is a start. Also returning the charger with the laptop after it has been sent with it.
Onsite	Provide better communication of when the part is expected to arrive.
Onsite	If a NEW issue is found or created by the repair, some proactive steps should be taken to address the issue. After completion of the MB replacement, I now get a SSD Error on boot, which the tech acknowledged before leaving. The only redeeming factor is that there is no SSD in the particular device.
Onsite	not lie, have better info for the call handlers, send the right part
Onsite	Send the correct part initially. The service rep was very efficient, unfortunately Lenovo sent the wrong part and the rep had to visit a second time after Lenovo finally sent the correct part
Onsite	Fix your call-center process that orders parts and give the work order to the technician. That is where your service failed.
Onsite	Simply improve the quality testing of the spare parts amd the machines that you are selling it to people.
Onsite	i need a call back in return
Onsite	better SLA on sending tech or parts out to users
Onsite	Faulty part replaced during second visit, it is resolved by next visit
Contact Center	Problem not fixed, haven't been contacted by repair person.
Contact Center	Less wait time.
Onsite	Take better care with making sure the right part is sent out, and taking better care to make sure the package is shipped directly to our facility rather than it get stuck in a UPS store 45 minutes away that only accepts pickups.
Onsite	The headache that your technical team doing with costumer as we given money then why should we diagnose the solution its your duty
Onsite	The wrong part was initially sent causing and extra day to get the machine running again.  The wrong part was obviously for a laptop, where the machine being serviced with a desktop ThinkStation.
Carry In / Walk - In	Solve the issues of keyboard, as per my knowledge most of the ideapad series having keyboard issues.
Onsite	Check part thoroughly before sending
Contact Center	Understand customers' need and market trend before responding at least to a customer who already purchased more than one Lenovo computers in one month.
Depot	Improve packaging and shipping box for replacement LCD units. Screen was shipped loose in a padded box. Movement in the Z direction was cushioned, but in the X and Y, the screen replacement could slide around in the box and hit the edges. Replacement screen arrived shattered in one corner, presumably from sliding into the edge of the box internals with force.
Onsite	Proper Planning of Service Engg Visit, informing schedule and being punctual
Contact Center	Be clearer about how to contact Lenovo for help.  Invest in repair shops in UK
Onsite	keep warranty parts in stock
Depot	Please improve warranty claim part waiting time.
Carry In / Walk - In	I received an email that said we been leaving you voicemail with no response. When Motorola has had phone, so I would not know how to check the voicemail.
Carry In / Walk - In	The time and frustration it took to get a resolution to my problem has left me confident this will be the last Motorola or Lenvova product I ever purchase.
Onsite	Deliver spare parts to the right city.
Onsite	I received an email - before the service rep even arrived at my house - saying my ticket was completed.At the time of service, is appears that the battery was not reconnected after the part was replaced, so my laptop now works only when plugged in.  Had to submit another ticket to get that fixed.
Depot	Send another box so I can send my under warranty unit. Box reported delivered. No box when I got home.
Onsite	Need professionals to handle operations not just anyone in the seat.
Onsite	took 2 month plus to arrange for a schedule, and a few more days to arrange the technician to come down. Hope that can be improve as X1 carbon came with next business day warranty.
Depot	Perform more extensive testing after attempting to repair an intermittent problem. User reported that problem has reoccurred.
Carry In / Walk - In	I would like an updated version of this tablet it's very frustrating
Onsite	call resolution time should be reduce.
Onsite	Everything was great and I would have given a 10 but the part was delayed
Depot	improved and better communication/update before and after machine is send.
Onsite	Not much communication of parts ordered and expected arrival. Once the service request was created by me, I got no feedback for about a week and a half until I called and asked why a tech had not called to schedule the service onsite. I was then told that parts were ordered and when they arrive the tech would call to schedule repair. I just worked out that the tech called on a date that I was in town and available to meet with him. I travel for work every week so unlike an office working at the same office 5 days a week, I am anywhere in the world from week to week.
Contact Center	Dont keep changing a person in charge of a case. Even though what was done is recorded in the system, the support will still do what the previous support had done which is very waste of our time even though we had told them what was already done.
Contact Center	No one has responded for my request to be called
Onsite	Keep parts in stock.  Don't tell customers that parts are on back order for two months for a brand new PC
Contact Center	Send the charger in the first request. Took 2 weeks to recieve it.
Contact Center	Have better contact form options
Onsite	provide new not refurbished parts
Onsite	Better coordination between Lenevo and your local parter Wipro. Also if customers can get easy access to escalation matrix in India. Unfortunately none from leadership team is involved - merely leaving service desk to resolve is not always helpful for important gaps in process.
Contact Center	No one called
Onsite	Brand new faulty laptop and replace all major parts but yet still not able to solve the problem
Contact Center	I was communicated my computer had a 24 hour fix guarantee. I was then told the part needed to be shipped the next day and the tech would call to fix the computer on Friday. I received no call. I emailed and call with no response. Then Monday, I had to call and escalate the delay before I finally received a call from the tech. Once I received the call, the issue was fixed within expectations.
Depot	FedEx messed up the old/new (prepaid) shipping labels and tried hard to deflect the blame of wrong delivery on to me. What really helped me make a strong case that it was their fault in delivering the laptop-to-be-repaired back to me is that their tracking service continued to show the package is still in transit.Please let the customer not go through the hassle of dealing with wrong courier delivery. Better communication among FedEx and Lenovo should solve such issues.
Depot	Customer service reps and their level on company procedures with third party repairs are lacking.
Depot	Calling was a pain because it took so long to get a hold of someone, and then after my repair went in, I had ZERO communication from Lenovo.  I even called in to get an update, and they wouldn't/couldn't tell me anything about how much longer or when it would ship back.  They also told me that I would get an email or call back by the next morning letting me know when the repair would come back, and I got no communication again.  The tablet showed up randomly about 5 days later and I got an email the next morning saying that the repair was still "in progress".  your system is broken.
Carry In / Walk - In	hope your department can finished the repair faster.
Onsite	Understand the real problems instead of addressing it superficially just to close a particular ticket
Depot	When I received my computer back it had a used screen that was greasy and there were crumbs all over the key board - disgusting!  I paid over $300+ to have this repaired and you would think I'd get a new screen and a clean computer!!!!
Depot	Provide tracking numbers of shipment
Depot	Spent a lot of time on the phone trying to get them to honor their warranty when I've worked in IT over 10 years and yet the last few months now it's like pulling teeth to get our Campus computers covered. We also now experience longer wait times on repairs as well. Hopefully this will lead to the school finding a new replacement for Lenovo.
Onsite	Order the part for my 2 machines I purchased and send to me ASAP (the 2 parts were omitted from my orders - I never received.
Contact Center	Nothing related to the support call.
Depot	Improve training of support specialists, to avoid promising services(return package delivery address change) which are not possible to fulfill.
Agent	Make service offered by all agents the same high standard
Onsite	Better estimates on whether or not the part is in stock. The back order on this made timing difficult to coordinate and required giving the user a loaner for traveling.
Depot	answer emails quicker or check up on latest returned item
Carry In / Walk - In	Providing service for unknown issues might be difficult, but better people make the experience better. I had to deal with a pretty unprofessional bunch. I approached Lenovo because I was in trouble but your people just made it worse.
Onsite	Make sure the correct part is ordered.
Depot	My computer was returned with the same problem it had when i sent it in.  ANYONE that turned it on could see the problem.  When i called back to let you know, they sent a box that didn't fit my all-in-1computer.Luckly i kept the box you sent it in.  Now it is on the way back and i can only hope it gets fixed this time.
Contact Center	Using Lenovo System update to "fill in the blanks" works on T460S, T406P, T480S, T480 but not for P320 Tiny.
Onsite	When a part is backorder, provide an ETA! Or at least tracking info.
Carry In / Walk - In	Please update the service center location. As I was suggested to go to lamington road service center first than to dadar location. Lamington service center is closed.
Depot	Please send e-mails giving updates, this because if you check the status online, it gives nothing. The only reason I don't put 0 is because the people with whom I got in contact were incredible and tried to help as much as possible
Onsite	provide new replacement parts that work
Carry In / Walk - In	i have been using laptop product ever since 2000 but integrity of Lenovo product is so terrible i spend 4000B for laptop but i have to fix the product in 1years two times. and also what kind bettey died in one year tome this ridiculous not just flat out battery life it was totally unable to recharg product. i belive that there have some problem about my laptop. i spend quite a lot of money nothing. there have no problem like this i cant find from  other company which as Samsung or LG ASUS. i am really disappointing product. if i can refund i wish to do so.
Onsite	Resolve my issue permanently on time ....
Onsite	expedite the service resolution time.
Onsite	Improve your technical expertise
Onsite	solve problem on time
Contact Center	Is not resolved yet, i am waiting
Carry In / Walk - In	Your dealer Depanero should be more, more professional!
Depot	Better on line updates.  quicker turn around on shipping the packing box and return of device.
Onsite	Only to ensure that bios updates dont stall and brick the machine.  It would have been good if the bios tune could have been recorded over the phone. Me having to record on my phone and send it in was a bit tricky.
Contact Center	Better response time to fault raised, spare parts availability.
Onsite	After multiple attempts and parts changed Lenovo Service Engineers are still not able to resolved the problem. Also damages the Laptop.
Contact Center	waiting for promised resolution
Onsite	Improve lead time on replacement parts
Depot	Listen careful to what end-user is telling yo about screen resolution there was nothing we could resolve over the phone as tried all that.
Onsite	Seeing as your "support representatives" over the phone truly don't know what a computer issue truly is, and are just following a script, all potential parts should be sent to an onsite technician based on computer problem. For instance, if its a power problem, a system board, CMOS battery, computer battery, and new power cable among any other parts should be sent to allow the technician the opportunity to fix the problem in one visit and not have to place more orders and wait and then have to make another visit. Whatever parts aren't needed can be sent back for re-packaging. It is an inconvenience to the customer and technician to have to call multiple times. Not sure why this is the process in general. If maybe a technician had everything they needed to complete a repair or determine a product didn't work after using the parts needed, then maybe you wouldn't have a customer without a computer for nearly 3 months.Still waiting on confirmation of replacement, and when will it happen? How long does it take a laptop to be shipped??
CRU	Send return package instructions
Contact Center	Maybe have better music and technically better sounding waiting music.
Depot	Improve your quality assurance, my machine has received 3 different panels already.
Contact Center	The call was a little hard to hear. I was in a public place, but my reception was seemingly fine and when I called someone else afterwards, I could hear the other line well. Otherwise, the person who helped me was very quick, efficient, and helpful. I also wasn't on hold forever and didn't have to deal with a bunch of automated steps before I was able to speak to someone on the phone which was nice.
Depot	I have been trying to get resolution of my case since June 2018! And it has still not been resolved.
Contact Center	With my busy schedule I liked that I could schedule a service call when I would be home as opposed to waiting on the phone. Unfortunately, the tech called 2.5 hours before the time I had requested and did not try to contact me again. It took me a few days to have the time to try again and I again scheduled a time for the service call. Again the tech called more than an hour in advance but this time I was home. While i appreciate that they got to me sooner than expected it isn't much help if I am unavailable when they call.
Contact Center	Ensure the technical support on the phone is really technical enough to solve the problem, and is proactive to help.
CRU	Faster delivery of the replacement parts would have been appreciated.Some communication issues were had with the customer service...I had to have him repeat things a couple of times.The biggest problem was that the harddrive had to be replaced on a computer that did not have a CDdrive...and you sent me CDs to reinstall the operating system! Who thinks that this is a good idea??? Why not send a USB with the information?
Onsite	Maybe be a little bit more flexible with repair times.
Contact Center	Restarting to see if suggested help will resolve issue, means "calling" back in and explaining problem multiple times. Even with notes on case this was time-consuming. Ideally need to be able to reconnect to same agent, after a restart.
Contact Center	I'm still waiting to have my E550 notebook repaired.   Firstly the part is not available at the Sydney repair depot which surprised me a lot.     I am to wait until the part arrives, then someone will take the notebook and send to Sydney and then I have to wait for the repair.   I was first quoted 7 days and now I am quoted over 4 weeks.   I'ts been about 3 weeks since I paid $275.00 for this service and still have not heard anything.   I am also very surprised that there is no depot set up in Melbourne.   It seems that Lenovo is a big company so that's why I am rather frustrated with this process.
Carry In / Walk - In	phone is still not fixed after three times.
Depot	The only way I found your number was via the wholesaler who sold the laptop (BT Business Direct). If a fault occurs the speed of the repair needs to be faster.
Depot	Faster return time. Defective mailing box
Onsite	Waiting for part and engineer
Contact Center	North American based help centre. Most of my time spent on the phone was me and the person on the other end not understanding one another.
Carry In / Walk - In	Service did not found any fault, however when pc was returned, the audio problem was no longer noticeable
Contact Center	After stating that the repairs would commence, I have not been updated about it yet. That was 14 days ago already.
Depot	Take care of service needs faster and also customer support can better address the case by email updates if it is taking longer than expected rather than customer being in dark about it.
Onsite	Ensure that Service Requests are updated correctly. We support global user base from the UK and rely on accurate updates to keep our users informed of their service. This is the only negative experience I've had with Lenovo
Onsite	After toooo many onsite visits the unit has been returned to the depot.
Depot	Audio quality when talking to support over the phone is terrible and it's very difficult for me to understand what people are sayingWait times to talk to support are very long (usually more than 15 minutes)Inconsistent support systems; I have to leave lenovo.com to go to managedtechnicalsupportaccess.com to make another account and open a support ticket, then I get an email from ibm.com confirming the receipt of the ticket, then i have to visit flex.com to track my repair status? How do I know I'm not being phished at any point in this process?The various support websites appear to be poorly maintained and don't always work.
Onsite	Send the right part the first time.  The omsight technician was great.
Carry In / Walk - In	Very unprofessional
Depot	Keep the customer informed and updated
Onsite	Send in the right part the first time
Depot	The problem was not resolved when my computer was returned to me
Carry In / Walk - In	our cell phone service was not available ,until we purchased a new cell phone from your competition,and the samsung 8 cell ,is of much better quality in screen resolution ,signal strength reception ,so the repaired motorola will remain in our junk drawer at home until I need a emergency phone ,for any trips away from home in this local area ,respectfully yours ,maricel p kleven 402 east 7th street starbuck,minnesota ,56381
Onsite	Make it clear on the Lenovo warranty website what phone number I am supposed to call, and that "next business day service" means only after Lenovo takes several business days to order the necessary parts.
Onsite	1) Find a better way to communicate the recall - I only discovered it when I went to your site to complete a software update.2) Although there was another device on location - The technician refused to check the other unit because no ticket was lodged - Which was contrary advise provided by the Cust Service rep on the initial call.  The technician didn't have the ability to check the spare unit and lodge the issue post assessment, resulting in a further delay  and time wastage with the technician having to re-viist the same site twice for the same issue.
Contact Center	I purchased the laptop in preparation to help find work, apply for jobs, rental searches etc following a planned move from the UK to Australia. The battery is faulty and despite contacting Lenovo UK and Lenovo Australia I got conflicting information and have been told there is no international warranty although this was never explained at purchase.
Contact Center	I do not think that the service could have been any better apart from getting through to an individual on the phone
Onsite	Service technicaln visit but prob is still pending
Contact Center	not charge 650 for a sub standard badly made laptop, firstly. Secondly your customer service is appalling, the speed at which tasks are actioned is a joke, and I find this survey an insult.
Onsite	check the part before relies.
Onsite	Lenovo took a long time to get my part
Onsite	Improve reliability and more importantly, NBD onsite service should not be constrained by unavailability of parts.  Our experience lately is that a repair takes in excess of two weeks to complete because of parts shortages
Depot	Better detail for holdups on the tracking webpage.
CRU	Please do not close case without shipping part
Onsite	Acknowledge when Lenovo makes a mistake and make it right with the customer.
Onsite	Parts need to be delivered on time
Onsite	Better customer service particularly when the customer has paid for the in site warranty.
Contact Center	Poor response
Carry In / Walk - In	I know your customer support and backend engineer are trying their best to resolve this problematic new Laptop, Unfortunately, the problem don't seen to going away after two attends by replacing several parts. Coming from the same field before, if such rare hardware issue keep surfacing without any resolution, the best way to protect the product image is to replace it since is within the warranty period. For example like IKEA, why they have a good and solid consumer name, is mainly due to a good maintenance and after sales services, and replacement policy. .
Agent	I spoke with several agents in various departments over the past couple of weeks.  I rated the service very low due to the interaction with one of the agents with whom I spoke.  Most of the agents were polite and did the best they could do given the situation but the last one was rude, was speaking with others during our discussion, shouted at me, and talked over my questions.  When I asked her not to talk over me, she became more rude and denied that she was shouting.  I became irritated and hung up on her.  She was from Atlanta supposedly.Listen to the recording and you will see about what I am speaking.  I admit I am frustrated as I thought I had purchased a 5 year on site service contract that covered the batteries, but apparently your system does not have that information in it.  The batteries have not lived anywhere close to the advertised life since the computer was new.  I had a service visit where the batteries were to be replaced, however, you only supplied the serviceman with one of the two batteries in the machine.  The BIOS was updated and everything checked out but both prior to the one battery being replace and after, battery life is limited to about 90 - 120 minutes with everything turned off (radio, microphone, camera, screen lighting, etc.), not the "up to 11 hours" that was touted when I purchased the machine.  Bottom line is that I purchased new batteries and found that your parts department do not even carry them.  I was given their phone number but they told me that they do not have them but could obtain them sometime in November.  I spent about 5 or 6 hours on this and considering the batteries only cost a little over $100 new, it was not worth the time or the frustration of being treated the way I was by the one agent.Feel free to contact me if you wish for any additional details at 312-307-8030.
Carry In / Walk - In	You guys are far more professional than most other companies.  You held your promise/warranty and with very little hassle.  Service was prompt and exceeded excitations.  Thank you!
Onsite	Availibility of parts
Depot	better communication of status updates.
Onsite	Send the right part for my lab top.
Contact Center	Case was cancelled and tech had not called.
Contact Center	I don't know, still waiting on you.
CRU	Lenovo lost the first service call and now still has not delivered the part.
CRU	It was difficult to communicate with your service agent, I had a hard time to understand what he was saying and need to repeat my answers to his questions multiple times for him to understand.Id prefer to have a live chat for support as I can describe my issues clearly to your support and send screen shot and follow their instructions clearly rather than call in.The new Lenovo pen pro does not work too and I havent had a chance to talk your support and they already sent an email to say to close the case. I understand I can still reopen it.
Onsite	More actively participate in the assessment of the laptop with regard to overall "health".  I had been experiencing increasing "strange" behavior on random occasions.  My company's IT department cleaned up the hard drive and then asked if there were any other problems.  When I mentioned the fan noise, that's all that was addressed.  I don't know how to assess the health status of the laptop.  I put most of the "blame/responsibility" for this concern on my company.  With regard to this call, the service that was requested was delivered as expected.  Sorry to vent!!
Carry In / Walk - In	On your website you mention for andriod updates for 2 years but you are not supporting any tablets. Shame for this
Contact Center	Keep your promises and better and available contact / communication. We should not have to chase getting the service we require and paid for.
Contact Center	Hire phone techs who speak English. Can't understand them.
Contact Center	No agreed plan to fix laptop and no contact from Digital River. And Lenovo have "closed the case"...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Carry In / Walk - In	Poor services we have to go at least 4 times to the service center then after that they get our mobile for the repairing, very disappointing.
Onsite	you all sent the tech the wrong parts
Depot	Lenovo has refused to further repair my $1000+ laptop webcam and microphone, even though the issue was identified during the warranty period and the laptop had being repaired three times. To make things worse, not only the issues were not resolved, but now the screen has a dark frame around it, from what it looks like a crude attempt and regluing the screen and the case together! Absolutely unacceptable customer service, but as mentioned Lenovo is now refusing to follow up on this repair until the issues are resolved.
Onsite	Kindly arrange the spare parts asap.
Onsite	Make sure the service agent has the right part
Onsite	Improve parts availability. as there was a delay in the fix due to the part not being available.
Contact Center	No one contacted me
CRU	Provide tracking information for the shipment of replacement part so I don't have to call to inquire about the shipping delay.
Onsite	Reduce turn around times, I logged in the Job on a Tuesday morning for a faulty SSD. The SSD replaced on Friday midday, so there was a 3 day wait time instead of the 24 hour turn around promised.
Onsite	to shorter the delivery time for part delivery
Depot	It took multiple call attempts (4-5+ times) in order to receive the shipping box to ship out my laptop to the depot center. It should have not taken 2 weeks to receive my shipping box. Afterward, I had to reach out to Lenovo find out my repair service was on hold. No one reached out to me, and the entire process from shipping out my laptop to receiving my laptop back was painful. The customer service/support service has gown downhill (especially with Lenovo Chat support). I've had better experiences with Dell and HP.
Onsite	My issue has still not resoveld and continuously receiving mails from the team that some one from the technical team someday wil come and see my issue ... i am still wiating for it
Onsite	As a vendor to my organization, Lenova had difficulty honoring the next day resolution. Perhaps a revision of process on how you use 3rd party vendors
Contact Center	No update on the quote for repair.
Onsite	Please don't ship the parts to customer
Onsite	Send the correct part based upon the description given or have the parts department call to confirm the item needed. Also when a technician schedules a time to meet I would expect that time to be kept not delayed several hours.
Onsite	Worst service from Lenovo as this problem not yet resolved and the case has been closed and sent for feedback.
Onsite	Unit came back with the aircard antennas plugged into the wrong ports. This lead to hours of diagnosing "Verizon account issues".
Onsite	provide updates as to progress on problem- ie. parts shipped, schedule a tech to come out without us needing to contact twice, address the issue in timely manner
CRU	Please don't send parts that aren't necessary to the wrong addresses. UPS delivery was not a good experience.
Onsite	the part took too long to arrive
Onsite	The replacement parts had been waited for almost 1 month for delivery, which is not acceptable. As one of a employer working in IT industry, I can't imagine that situation if it is happening in a commercial environment. Also, I called to the Lenovo hardware repairing department for an additional 2.5" harddisk rack plus SATA power cable for my SSD, there was no stock available (The 2.5" harddisk rack for Thinkstation P330 SFF)  together with a unreasonable price. The after sales customization service is poor than Dell & HP.
Contact Center	Improve your support agreement with IBM and give them better opportunity to deliver good service locally - I feel they are limited by the lousy agreement what Lenovo have pushed on to them. How can Lenovo - the largest PC provider in the world - accept to deliver so poor service and have a so distant representation in Denmark.
Depot	Extend return period.
Carry In / Walk - In	I kept having to answer the same questions over and over again. When I received the replacement phone, the representative had no idea what I was asking for and kept saying I needed to pay another fee on the replacement phone I had JUST gotten from Moto. I was not told I might have to go to Sprint to have the SIM card activated; otherwise I would have gone there as soon as I received the replacement. To top it off, the replacement phone I received also just died without warning when it was charging. This has been a terrible experience and I wouldn't consider Moto again. Which is really sad since I work for Lenovo and will return to buying our competitors phones.
Onsite	I process many problems and solve them so I am not quite remembering this particular issue.  If I don't remember it , it must have been a smooth transaction.  So we're good.  And so are you.
Onsite	Fix your broken level 1 support - or use it for home / residential users only and bump actual Lenovo partners up to level 2 automatically.
Contact Center	Shorter wait time on the phone.  I waited almost an hour on phone before someone picked up.  I couldn't go online because there was no power on my laptop.
Depot	Actually fix my laptop instead of send it back with the same problem 2 times.
Carry In / Walk - In	immediate resolution.
Onsite	Follow up by e-mail as to when parts may be in
Contact Center	The waiting time
Depot	better warranty support streamlined  shipping process the warranty should cover shipping to and from your warehouse and your warehouses should have all or replacement parts in stock
Onsite	Recheck the refurbished parts ,
Contact Center	Convoluted automated system did not direct me to the correct support area - had to call three times.  More clear instructions are needed to associate different types of machines/products supported by different teams
Depot	I have been given no updates.  this is the first come.
Depot	faster send in and return time, possible option to send to Lenovo via Fed EX or UPS store
Depot	quit calling it a case number, when all paper work we receive from you calls it a service order. With some companies they are totally different numbers which get totally different results, so please get everyone on the same page and just call it a work order, case number, or service order, but have everyone (including Paperwork) call it the same.
Depot	did not receive desktop back on the delivery date after receiving emails desktop had been sent to FedEx for delivery and would receive on the delivery date specified on time. It had not been sent. When I did not receive it, I contacted FedEx.  I had to make several phone calls to Lenovo to track it down. It had not been sent to FedEx only paperwork but no product. When I found it finally, it was still sitting at the repair center. After more phone calls, I received it days later thrown into a huge box that would probablly hold three or four computers, nothing was wrapped or separated but thrown all in together into the huge box like trash. It was nothing like the way I shipped it to you. Every part was returned to you in bubble wrap separately then foam was added as more protection for shipping and in an appropriate box. I made pictures before I shipped it and pictures when I received it.It was listed as $599.99 with $200.00 instant savings and the final cost was $438.99 plus I had to pay charges to return it for repairs. To me this was a lot of money for a product that began having problems immediately after I purchased it. I will never purchase this brand again.  I have had many different computers and this is the worst one yet.  It would not have been such a giant disappointment if the service after purchasing it had not been a NIGHTMARE!
Onsite	3 tickets placed and closed, parts supposedly ordered and never installed , poor communication
Contact Center	Provide a correct telephone number on your website for matters that need  customer service.  The present one does not exist according to BT
Onsite	Stock Lenovo parts to reduce service time
Contact Center	First time i called they didn't fix the issue. it came back. but the second time i called they put me onto the Lenovo vantage which did all the updates and fixed the issue
Onsite	Not much, I got the most professional care I could have got. The guy that exchanged my screen was also funny and a over all great guy.
Depot	Send me this survey when I receive my product back so I can better answer these questions.
Depot	Improve the quality of service provided by depot repairs; improve training and or resources for escalation agents so they can provide correct resolutions and information.
Onsite	Give updates on expected arrival of tech.  I ordered the parts on a Friday, but tech did not appear until Tuesday, but in the meantime I wasn't sure when he was coming.
Carry In / Walk - In	I still not received my phone, service centre person are just like the illiterate person. They cant even solve the issue in 20 days, very worst customer service i have ever seen
Depot	no one could track my order - it showed up eventually
Onsite	Quicker engineer visit to site after part has been delivered.
Depot	I can't charge it returned for the third time
Onsite	Keep parts on hand so that they are not always back ordered.
Onsite	delay in part arrival
Depot	Make tracking experience graphical
Contact Center	more detailed updates of Lenovo actions
Onsite	Order the right parts needed for my computer the first time, after a thorough assessment is completed as to what the problem is.  I had to replace my harddrive already in July this year ... so clearly the actual quality of work be computer parts is seriously flawed.  Honestly, I will never be purchasing a Lenovo again and will never recommend any Lenovo products to friends or family in the future. Rather, I will actively deter people from purchasing Lenovo products.  I have consistently encountered rude employees and horrifically poor customer service since  I purchased my Thinkpad close to three years ago.  My frustrations with this company have been never ending.
Onsite	Have parts ready when it is a product recall and part is likely to be faulty.
Depot	Provide a tracking number for when the product is mailed back. Improve the online status repair so that it is more informative.
Onsite	Faulty parts not available in the first attempt
Depot	Resolve issue with courier leaving laptop outside the house when no ATL was given and also leaving card saying it had been returned to depot.
Carry In / Walk - In	The company has provided Android 8 update, which is creating a lot of issues such as over heating, discharges quickly, not getting charged, phone slow down, etc. And moreover when we reach a nearby service center they are even unable to degrade the Android version to 7, n giving us the reply that the company had already removed the version from service. My point of view is that how can a company launch a version without monitoring it's trails and moreover they r doing nothing for the inconveniences.
Carry In / Walk - In	I had almost visited the service centre for 4-5 times with the same problem of Battery Draining and Phone getting switched off.Everytime I got the same resolution of getting Software updated but my problem haven't resolved.When I asked to change my battery inspite of having in the warranty one of your employee named Mr.Pradeep neglected to do the same as he says "Everytime I need to update my software whenever this problem occurs and was rude to me".This kind of service you provide to the customer??Again I have submitted the phone for the last time and hope I receive my phone in better condition.Thanks and Regards,Aakash Kamble.
Onsite	have a sufficient inventory of common parts such as a mother board
Contact Center	The waiting time was quite excessive, however this is just the luck of the draw. Overall though your employee did her best even though the problem was not resolved after downloading new drivers.
Onsite	you Utterly failed to manage your resources and even worse were unable to even realize it and so continually provided false information to your customer with no appropriate escalation path to resolution.  You attempted to assign a tech who was out on vacation and not returning calls.  You then compounded the error by continually doing the exact same exercise and texting yourselves internally all the while committing to the client that they would receive a call back.  After no less than 6 CLIENT originated calls nothing was done differently. Had the tech not returned from vacation Im quite sure Id still be calling and still be being told to simply wait for someone to call me.This service was a complete and utter failure on your part and I am now reconsidering any new purchases of your products even though I have used and generally loved my Thinkpad s for over 20 years.  Im very disappointed in you!
Onsite	Originally the wrong parts were ordered , so the process took a little longer.  No big deal but just an fyi.
Onsite	By providing clear ETA on resolutions
Contact Center	provide direct contact to service person and operate and resolve query instant (when i open my laptop that time very slow and continue loading 30 to 40 min.for window open and yet not solve my problem)
Depot	more updates
Depot	I have called 4 times and gotten support to attempt to fix the computer and it never worked. Now, after sending it in to be repaired it is still having the same issues and more. I want a computer that works. The computer is now a paperweight.
CRU	Please try to resolve issue on time and focus on delivering of spare parts within the time frame.
CRU	- Provide explanation of expected performance for part described in ticket- Offer free pick-up or shipping via USPS for returned part (UPS drop-box not nearby)
Contact Center	Don't install windows 10 on a laptop that doesn't have enough memory to complete the necessary updates.
Onsite	Field engineer should not ask working PC for testing parts.
CRU	Have someone call me to talk about the problem before sending me the wrong part that doesn't fix my issue. I just sent back the unused replacement part because you guys don't know my configuration.
Onsite	Improve the support resolution time.
Onsite	speed up delivery of parts.
Depot	Just replace the laptop, don't waste my time and yours trying to fix problem, the second time. Your QC did not to their job.
Contact Center	Shorter wait time on the phone.  Avoid need for recalls.
Contact Center	I cannot respond to this question because I just received this notebook a couple of days ago.  I need time to get used to it.
Carry In / Walk - In	I didn't receive call from service center that your laptop is ready. after 3 days of inward i called them to check that laptop is ready or not then they replied your work done. So please tell them to call customer that work done from our side please collect.   Anyway overall Service is experience is excellent.
Onsite	Respond within 24 hours with a plan, whether it be to send a part, send a technician, or depot the machine.
Onsite	Took awhile, they didn't have the part so we had to wait. Technician was fine, just the delay in the part being shipped.
Onsite	First person I spoke with rattled on about how busy he was, and finally I said, that's okay, you can come tomorrow.  Tomorrow came and I didn't hear anything an round 4 I called.  They said they would have someone call.  They did and I rescheduled with another person for the next day.  Just give me a time and date, and if you can't come, let me know that too.
Contact Center	Assigned person to process the request is has no update.
Onsite	having the necessary parts on hand would shorten the wait time.
Onsite	Use better parts so that it doesn't need to be fixed again as this is the second time camera is replaced
Depot	Have a more timely return for the product. I felt that I was told it would come earlier than it did.
Contact Center	follow up with us after the part was shipped to us for replacement it was just forgotten and no more contact.
Depot	Timely progress updates.
Onsite	X1 tablet Device over heats, camera fails, system blue screens. Just dont do any of those
Depot	I received no feedback on problems identified and/or changes made to the system. To the best of my knowledge, I sent my computer to you and you returned it (the same one w/o changes?) without looking at it.
Agent	Lot of steps before you get to the final agent.
Carry In / Walk - In	More update about my laptop
Onsite	Have parts
Onsite	Give training to your technical support team (On phone). They are bunch of jokers who knows nothing about their products.
Depot	Computer was sent away with power cable but power cable has not been returned
Contact Center	Pick up the phone faster
Onsite	I have a next business day contract, and it took several days for the repair to be "completed". The tech who replaced the defective part didn't reassemble my computer properly, so I had to take it apart and reconnect the speaker harness he disconnected. I'm more concerned about the loose screw he left behind -- not just because I didn't see a place to put it, but also because it could have caused much more damage.
Carry In / Walk - In	I received a replacement device that was defective through the advanced replacement program.  After sending it back, I received a 2nd replacement device.  Both devices have displays that are inferior to my original device.  The color is poor and "whites" look dull and gray.  Screen brightness about 1/2 that of my original device.  I wanted to send back the 2nd replacement for a device that is equivalent to my original, but customer service could not guarantee that I would receive such a device.  I am tired of the games.  The prolonged security hold is ridiculous.  I have asked on multiple occasions for a refund of the $24.99 because I can't get a descent replacement device in a reasonable amount of time.
Onsite	Send out status updates of open cases either daily or every other day.
Depot	Faster turn around times. Laptop sat for 8 days before repairs began.
Onsite	My only complaint is related to the long delivery time for the ordering of the spare parts
Carry In / Walk - In	Speed of the entire process, along with the ease of returning the damaged phone.
Depot	Perhaps provide more explanation in the resolution notes of the ticket
Onsite	Faulty should be replaced with tested part.
Agent	Initial hold time was long
Depot	Provide better training for employees and have a faster turn around time.
Onsite	return calls to setup appointment.  Should not need to be 1 month before repairs are made.
Onsite	It takes very long time for parts to order and arrive. Customers cannot have their device down for weeks and not able to work. We receive way better service from HP support.
Contact Center	Answer the phone.  Don't leave your Premier Support customers on hold for more than 90 minutes.  Let your regular Lenovo support people handle Premier Support tickets.
Depot	Ensure that recommended system updates do not brick the laptop.
Contact Center	make it easier to find Lenovo's technical support phone number with a Google search
Depot	Multiple attempts to create a service ticket online failed told not to worry about problem is fan not working from online support but then the unit started to melt . Took a week of trying to get through to phone support but when I did they arranged collection and service straight away unit fixed and back with me within 2 weeks over Xmas period .
Onsite	It may better if they give technical support in weekend and after business hour. After business hour user not able to log their complaint also
Onsite	Please diagnose the issue and after finding exactly why the issue is occurring then only give proper related technical services to the customer
Onsite	Fix it the first time out, not messing things up requiring two more rounds of parts ordering and tech appointments.
Onsite	Don't send that tech who came to our site
Depot	update page did not work to keep apprised of status.
Onsite	Suggest draining the battery completely as part of troubleshooting.
Onsite	There is a small part missing near the hinge to cover up the wires inside. Also, I am not satisfied with the screen which has been set up. Its the third time some technician had come over to set up a new screen on site. The working of the screen doesn't have any issue, but the screen has not been put up properly. The screen is still not intact to the body of the laptop
Depot	I couldn't access the tracker online. Could have been my fault though.
Depot	Additional Contact with customer - the repairs required an order of a part that took longer than expected.  The website would not update the process and calls to the center did not provide any additional detail.  Keeping the customer informed of the steps being taken would be appreciated.
Contact Center	Still waiting for box for return.
Onsite	Send all the parts promised the first time so a second trip is not necessary.
CRU	CSR can be more helpful, talking to a lenovo partner on a DOA keyboard, and didn't want to ship the keyboard because the Lenovo tech site was down.
CRU	Need your support for delivery of spare parts on time, we need to do follow up with front office team for the status of spare parts delivery, please focus on this part.
Onsite	At least on support on enterprise level, kindly prioritize and don't let the customer wait for your internal processes if the final resolution is replacement by any way. I had several previous experiences (This current case only is exception on resolution in very first visit) with Lenovo and HP regarding the delay in process, instead of knowing that the part needs to be delivered, they asked engineer to visit first. They could have sent the engineer with replacement part and then troubleshoot the old part here with client, and if not done, he can replace immediately. Why letting the customer wait again and again inspite of knowing that there is business urgency. We have a lot of Lenovo machines here in Intel Technologies, and if this kind of service level is repeated, then you guys have to seriously work on this.
Onsite	Sending the proper parts
Carry In / Walk - In	No new things have updated
Onsite	Lenovo technical team should call back to customer if call is being disconnected in mid of conversation. When customer is calling it starts from again step 1. I have faced this issue multiple times because call getting disconnected various times due to poor Network.
Depot	pay for shipping returns
Onsite	Notify the customer when that part is actually ordered and its estimated time for delivery. That information was Not forthcoming.
Contact Center	Respond to your customers with regular updates
Onsite	I had to schedule the repair three times, as the system in customer service department could not recognize my machine code, whereas the Technical Support system was able to do so. Repair was delayed for two weeks, and I was only able to get it done through requesting to speak with one of the managers myself.
Onsite	Have a better stock of parts that are not DOA or on backorder. Had to wait a week each time part was ordered.
Onsite	sparepart replacement take too long, please improve on this issue
Contact Center	Have suitable technical check and repair service locally in UK.
Onsite	Improve your technical support on phone. They know nuts abiut anything.
Depot	Better feed of information when undergoing repairs, faster repair time (or at least reasonable estimates). It felt like calling Lenovo was almost necessary to remind them that my device was being repaired.
Carry In / Walk - In	expedite the server, delivery parts and replacement.
Depot	returned DOA!!!! Effort to follow up with a registered warranty depot technician
Onsite	Faster resolution!
Onsite	Avoid reused parts or check it thoroughly...
Onsite	as mentioned earlier, defected motherboard and motherboard with wrong configuration were sent for part replacement. In future, this kind of things should be taken care of
Contact Center	Estimated waiting time is too far off from actual time. A better time estimate to alert consumer would be better.
Onsite	The replacement part turned out to be faulty and I didn't know who to contact after I realized it.
Carry In / Walk - In	Don't even need afew times of repair as it was unnessary!
Onsite	the whole service experience, except for the technician that came to our home was slow, cumbersome and inefficient from the consumer's perspective. It might make things cheaper for Lenovo but is nowhere near good enough from the customer's end. Far better to allow customers deal directly with the local service agent. Your online "expert" got the parts order wrong (ordered a touch screen for a non touch screen model) and only corrected it when I pointed it out. "Guessing" what parts are required from a online description or photos can lead to unnecessary cost to your customers. Do you refund for unused parts????
Depot	with warranty they should give shipping labels all the thime
Onsite	reduce major failures like mother board failures, a more important part like power switch  kept on side is prone to easy damage. need to move or make it more rugged.
Depot	This is a multiple device issue and can keeps reoccurring
Onsite	Fulfil your obligation with business warranties. Give me updates on a daily basis. Allow me access to your formal complaints channels including an account manager
Onsite	Parts are on backorder when we requested the same part for the same model a day ago with no backorder status?
Depot	Computer was broken when I received it back after waiting a month. Had to re-send. Still waiting. Computer was in new condition when I mailed it but I was getting the blue screen. Only purchased the end of March 2018. Requested replacement which was denied. Still waiting.
Onsite	Better communication between central support staff and field technicians, particularly during on-site visits.
Carry In / Walk - In	It was easy to setup a return but the instructions sent with the replacement device were poor.
Carry In / Walk - In	Not the guy who help me fault but don't agree with getting refurbished phone because of an update that messes up battery.  Hadn't had my phone got a year.  Plus I don't get an extended warranty.  Crock of crap in my opinion
Contact Center	Solve the issue rather than closing the issue.Nobody called me, yet the ticket has been closed. And I responded to the mail's saying nobody called.
Onsite	better website access to returns
Contact Center	When I call and the connection is routed to a foreign country, it is very difficult to understand that person and their troubleshooting skills leave much to be desired. No offense to anyone because I have love in my heart. I would prefer to have someone in the US available for troubleshooting purposes
Depot	Better status updates when computer is being shipped back ect.
Onsite	We trust the lenovo product and their performace, however right from sales thru the delivery it went wrong for me, please guide properly such that customer can relay on the product and look forward for purchasing more, i purchased recently and something went wrong i need to call many times and finally i need to  take dayoff and wait for service egineer, however i still trust you guys and recommend to my company to purchase Lenovo products for my engineers, such strongly i trust you guys. My laptop is in warrenty and you opened infront of me and replaced the damaged part which is bad, as i purchased new one or old one?  how can i trust and recommend for others. Please dont do this to me. Really i am upset and loss of 68000/-
Onsite	Took cover 2 months.No update form Lenovo.
Onsite	better quality control of parts and build of the laptop
Onsite	Shipped the incorrect part.
Contact Center	He couldn't wait to get rid of me and send me to software support. I had multiple questions, one of which was hardware related. Had to figure it out on my own.
Onsite	Still attempting resolution now, weeks later.
Depot	Fix problem and dont damage goods and return them damaged without fixing initial problem. Do no say you will call back in an hour if you are not going to.
Onsite	Have parts on-hand
Depot	problem not resolved and laptop returned without network adapter
Carry In / Walk - In	The product I received had issues with the home button. After I availed the warranty, the issues were resolved but I was returned the phone with more than a few scratches on the screen
Onsite	The engineer who has come to check the laptop was not experienced i feel. he was calling someone and asking what to do. how will the other guy know the exact issue over phone? Try to send experienced guys.
Carry In / Walk - In	The device I received as a replacement isn't as responsive as it should be. I've had to power cycle the device in order to get apps to close or open properly. I was unable to even answer an incoming call the other day because the touch screen wasn't responding until I tapped the power button closed the screen & reopened it. I work in cellular sales & this is now my 2nd bad experience with a Motorola device. The shipment was fast & I'd be very satisfied if the device sent to me worked properly
CRU	Ensure instructions are accurate. Make tech support responsible for resolving issues instead of volume of calls. Tech support told me they were not allowed to re-iterate instructions that were sent via mail even though I told her instructions were not accurate.
Contact Center	Better phone support.
Contact Center	Shorter wait time
Depot	I was  told that I would have my device back within a week of sending it in and planned around that. I did not receive my device back in the mail until over two weeks later.
Onsite	faster service in term of sending techical staff to checknthe laptop and part replacement. Part replacement waiting was a bit long. Techical support in the line mention to replace the hdd and optane but when the technical support come only change the hdd and say optane have to wait again. few days later received email that the part will only arrive in Dec, it took very long, until complaint was fail and the part was replace the next day. We hope the service can be improve faster
Depot	Faster resolution (i sent my laptop on the 9/02/2018 and received it on the 29th/02/2018)
Contact Center	Answer the phone faster
Contact Center	The phone number for technical support is hard to find on the website.
Carry In / Walk - In	Just received phone 4 days ago and already having major issues and having to order another phone. Not happy with phone that keeps messing up.
Onsite	Write down the serial correctly and have parts in your inventory. There were delays in assigning a technician and the wrong parts were sent to us after waiting 2 weeks to get a new screen!!!
Depot	I had a hard time getting in contact with anyone to set up repair on my computer anytime I tried (2 times now), and there was a extremely long wait from the time i sent my computer in to when it was logged as received and worked on.
Onsite	Improve technical skills in staff
Depot	I received a defective computer and have never talked to anyone that cares or helps
Depot	update the solvup case with the connote and dispatch advice instead of separate emails making the pick up procedure confusing
Depot	Laptop sent back for second repair, awaiting return.
Depot	faster repair time.  more clear on the warranty.
Carry In / Walk - In	You withdrew my security deposit immeadiatly but then take 10 business days to credit it back after you receive my broken phone. And so far my account has not been credited back the 450.00... Before I received my replacement phone you were sending me a email to send my broken phone in. ... Not real happy about this
Onsite	make spare parts available in an urgent fashion.
Agent	shorter hold time
Depot	The issue is a problem on several devices as seen on threads online from the Lenovo community
Contact Center	Provide better status updates and clarify next steps and timelines.
Carry In / Walk - In	I did achieve a fair outcome -- replacement of failed device -- but it took arguing with 3 CSRs and the intervention of a manager who agreed with my requested resolution to the problem.
Onsite	Replaced the faulty part
Depot	Better support and follow up service, no shipping fees unless warranty expired or personal damage to unit. Faster repairs or replace new unit right away !!!
Onsite	Waiting for replacement cos laptop unusable and below normal speef even after changing parts
Onsite	Should be able to provide support on time without delay. Onsite Engineer is a better solution rather than recommending troubleshooting steps for critical issues.
Onsite	There was a slight delay after the parts were couriered and a service representative contacting me to attend to installation.
Depot	Machine is in for repair, has been for over a month with no status and no resolution.
Carry In / Walk - In	When I tried to call to get an update, the telephone was not attended to.
CRU	When a new computer is bad on delivery.....SEND a new one to replace if a part is not immediately available...
Contact Center	Dont hang up on callers
Onsite	Tech was sent the wrong part. The label on the part was correct, but the correct label was put on the wrong part.  Another tech came by another day.
Onsite	Hire more professionals like Mr. Carl Wilson.
Depot	Nothing, I received first call service
Onsite	There were issues with the delivery of required parts.  The issues delayed the repair a number of weeks.  Unfortunately, the issue may have been on our end.
Carry In / Walk - In	Problem not resolve, received with same
Onsite	Increase speed of parts delivery.
Onsite	Improve parts availability. Engineer should,be able to advise if it is thought to operator damage. Have two unsucessful visits, then had to send machine away, then told it iwas customer damage and told I would have to pay 125 +++++ to get back! Machine has now beenout of action for 4 weeks. It contains unique information and is causing a substantial headache.
Contact Center	Would help as a low tech/senior user to get directions in the box about loading all updates. I do understand the PC may have been packaged for awhile and need updates but there have been far more then I expected
Contact Center	Shorter wait times for phone.
Contact Center	Improve communication and updates
Carry In / Walk - In	3 month after solve my problem and they was saying call.me we have received product then you come
Onsite	Provide or at least streamline information to customer as to the timing of the parts delivery. I  was told the parts would be installed within 2 days of receipt generally but no one could tell me when the parts would be received, I had to call back another number and then another number and finally was connected with someone who could disclose when the parts were to be delivered.  Once delivered very satisfied with the actual installation.
Depot	Improve communication between the tech's., that we talk to, with our problems and the people that actually work on our units.
Onsite	make the delivery of parts better
Depot	Speed up the repair times. This was a brand new computer that failed to boot up. I had to wait for 3 weeks for the lifecycle of the repair. DHL - chosen logistics partner were very poor.
Carry In / Walk - In	Handset was never working as expected right from day one of purchase, I have given it for three times to repair but it hasn't functioning well still
Onsite	Lenovo used to provide service the same day parts arrived.  Since changing service providers, timeliness and communication have declined.
Onsite	Spareparts quality, onsite technicians and better instructions regarding CRUs.
Onsite	Have more service parts so I don't have to wait for parts from China. Always an issue for us. We have another case that was a two month wait for a new screen. Toshiba is never short on parts. You need more in your local depot. In another instance, had to wait three months for new laptop chargers for LP80 ordered from a PO (10 Oct - early Jan.) Regarding on site representative: arrived two hours outside given timeframe, had a language barrier, had to ask to repeat themselves. We have two offices serviced by different Lenovo teams. Olympic Park team is hit and miss, CBD team keeps forgetting to turn off bit locker encryption - ongoing issue. Don't know how that keeps getting missed, creates unnecessary work for my team.
Depot	Because my device has now been sent away for repair a third time with the same issue and still hasn't been returned.
Onsite	the part was installed but the device still not working
Depot	My item was returned damaged and when I contacted you via the website, I did not receive a reply. I also found it hard to access information about my delivery. Item was left with neighbour but I got no notification of this.
Depot	Website issues, unable to track order
Depot	Make repairs faster by stocking commonly needed parts or swap out small items such as tablets.
Depot	actually fix the problem, I have had next day on-site service out four times and now sent it in to the depot twice and still not fixed.
Agent	Why are there no email notifications, and no email follow ups when I put in a ticket?
Carry In / Walk - In	Poor poduct quality, the rep was good and professional
Onsite	Follow up by the phone support tech to ensure that the part order on the original service call (406M3LC) would have been nice. Instead I had to call in 3 days later because I'd never been contacted to setup the repair appointment.
Carry In / Walk - In	The phone was returned without the back plate. It took 13 minutes and 2 departments to tell me the back plate was sent separately after calling the inquiry phone number and incident number you provided me.  There should have been an email notification of separate shipments, paperwork with the shipment, or at minimum a note on my account when I called. It did not help that both the people I spoke with had a very limited understanding of English furthing the frustration.  Ridiculous
Depot	Better quality on track pads, Durability.
Contact Center	The support worker assisted in helping the issue, but did not totally resolve it. The touch screen element of the computer is faulty and the support worker assisted in helping me to switch of the touch screen element, but the issue still remains.
Onsite	faster availability of parts for repair
Contact Center	Answer phone more rapidly
Onsite	Faster delivery of parts.
Contact Center	We are waiting for someone to come collect the laptop as it is not working.
Contact Center	Please provide proactive status update
Depot	Keep website updated. (at least showing record of receipt).  This avoids customers calling in to inquire.  Lenovo Mirage Cameras need better support contact information.  Confusing for customers looking for help.
Contact Center	actually listen to my complaint and respond to what I have queried . yo have asked for me to supply information and when I did u still did not reply . my query remains unresolved
Contact Center	lots of errors with the device, first  of all battery only charges to about 95% and says plugged in not charging, battery life is around 4 hours if generous even though when buying it says 7 hours. many other errors occured wasting my good time in the progress of fixing
Agent	Not keep people on hold for so long. Advertise that you are a helpdesk, it was very hard to find the correct number to ring.
Depot	Take the initiative with updating your customers and actually send a return box
Contact Center	Was never updated regularly as to the status of my case. Continually had to call and was advised numerous times by different support staff I would be called back. Resulted in me writing an email with my dissatisfaction at Lenovo support.
Onsite	my details where incorrectly attached to parts delivered to university. Both names and email address!
Onsite	Better Service after sales, telephonic technical supports must required
Contact Center	still waiting computer from repair
Depot	Communication was poor, no email updates were sent out, long wait on priority line
Depot	There was no effort at all to inspect or replace the hardware of the faulty unit. It was simply returned to us with just a new image applied. It crashed as soon as we started it and logged in. We have had to contact our reseller (Softcat) directly and replaced the unit with them instead.
Onsite	New issues developed when the engineer came to solve the existing ones.
Carry In / Walk - In	Problem that I was facing didn't occur while your team kept my laptop under observation. They have returned my laptop as it is and told me that they are not closing the complaint and will contact me after a week. Now I am getting auto turn on problem with my laptop. That earlier Blue Screen problem happened just once since I got my laptop from  your service center.
Contact Center	Answer the phone quicker By pass some of the automative talk. Overall your technical support was great, it solve my pc issues.
Contact Center	Everything. Faster response time, better support options. The situation was stalled so much that I'm now out of time.
Depot	Provide a box and shipping label for all equipment that is under warranty. Customers should not have to pay for shipping and handling for an issue that isnt under warranty
Onsite	Lenovo should try to reduce the time taken by customer executive to  transfer my call to technical team. It took 2-3 attempts to talk to the technical team
Onsite	Highly unprofessional, inefficient and unacceptable service provided.
Contact Center	waiting time to speak to consultant was to long
Onsite	I think having parts in the USA rather than having them shipped here in a leaky boat from China during a hurricane would be a step in the right direction.  Doesn't logistics help predict how many spare parts will be needed in a given country based on the units purchased/shipped?
Depot	faster service time/shipping, in-store repairs?
Contact Center	I don't know, this was my first time calling
Onsite	faster time to repairservice engineer to arrive when agreed (possible delay due to snow)
Agent	The experience can be improved with reliable customer service agents, knowledgeable and engaged technicians, timely service, or just a working computer.
Carry In / Walk - In	Live updates on what is happenning
Contact Center	Nothing on this call.  Everything was excellent.
Onsite	your service boy should be more professional and educated.
Onsite	Since this was a hardware (hard disk replacement) related issue and all the details were already shared with support center with log files, it was too much time taken by lenovo to dilivered part , Being a corporate customer we were expecting it could happen within 3days or max 5days. There was no proper follow-up call or update received from support, Everytime we got the same answer and We had to do a Follow-up. Hopefully we will get prompt support from Lenovo in future.
Onsite	Figure out a way to actually send the password reset emails when someone clicks the change password link on the website. Figure out a way for phone calls to take less than 45 minutes to get a person on the line. Hire people who listen when you tell them what part you need.
Contact Center	They punted. After several calls over several weeks in which I was transferred to at least 8 people, some repeats who decided to send me to someone else instead of resolve my issue, I was finally told that a lost computer report has been put in and that I would get a call following up shortly. It's two days later. No call. Back to square one? Most likely. 1 month without a computer as a student. I'm pretty disappointed in the service. It's been awful.
Contact Center	The question  was not answered - I was told to contact sales - who didn't understand.I thought Technical Support was where you went for techical support - and sales was were you went to buy new kit!  Apparently not at Lenovo!
Contact Center	I was not contacted for further support. I was told to send proof of purchase which I did and was not contacted after.
CRU	Not ask me to complete a survey just after I submit a request to have parts shipped out, then I myself have to schedule yet another appointment for a tech to come out. Poor service.
CRU	Numbers on DVDs and instruction paper didn't match. Shocking!
Contact Center	Better telephone support, communication with new customers. Better communication with supplier and distributor.
Depot	Pay for return shipping.
Contact Center	Make a computer that doesn't loose it's sound every time Microsoft does an update.
CRU	I called a total of three times on this issue - once, the technician entered the incorrect serial number, which resulted in the wrong part being shipped to me. The second time, I called to remedy having gotten the wrong part, got the serial number straightened out, but the installation media I requested was not sent with the replacement part, so I had to call a third time to get that. You could best meet my expectations by making a standard practice of shipping out installation media with a replacement hard drive OR by making download of that media a standard part of the support response when a hard drive is being replaced. For several years, the process of making installation media from a new computer using Lenovo tools has been cumbersome enough - both time consuming and prone to error - that we stopped creating our own media some time ago.
Depot	Per FedEx, the return box has not shipped; it shows as "Pending".
Contact Center	phone selections in more simpler terms. not everyone is that technical.
Depot	parts required left waiting a month and half to come in on a 6 month old machine. was initially kept updated on status. received email from guy saying waiting for the parts then heard nothing. waited two weeks and sent nasty email. came back to me and quickly sent a Tech but nothing could be done, needed parts. updated me saying they needed parts on back order. heard nothing after that and then the tech just turned up.
Depot	Send info when returning the Product. The computer arrived at my door unannounced
Onsite	meet deadlines & accurate resolution in 1st attempt
Contact Center	Poor support, multiple contacts, no machine pickup, no resolution. One month later
Contact Center	Produce a machine that is compatable with any windows 10 update.
Onsite	Give separate contact details for technical queiries
Contact Center	Quicker response times for business
Depot	When sent in repair for the first time, Lenovo stated that "to ensure the highest level of quality and reliability, every laptop is fully tested and inspected by a quality inspector." I received my laptop back with windows not activated so the above statement is a LIE. Had my laptop simply been turned on, this issue would have been noticed and hopefully not been sent back to me in this condition in the first place or, for whatever reason, the condition of the operating system is not included in the HIGHEST level of quality and reliability. The operating system was not part of the initial issue but was induced during the repair process for another issue. Incredibly disappointed in the quality of my first Lenovo product ever and am very close to giving up and returning this laptop that has yet to function without any problems.
Contact Center	I was never contacted by a technician about fixing my laptop
Depot	Plz providing resolution As days which  suggested support spokesperson.
Depot	Insure you are shipping the correct size box for the return
Onsite	By some more improving the quality of the product and speedy resolution.
Contact Center	List of Lenovo product models on webpage (or atleast a downloadable pdf with specific model types, i.e 20JH002SMX, vs NMX, etc).Be clear when terms and services change. I have lost the ability to use Lenovo Connect, and I purchased this model for basically that reason alone.
Onsite	Your employees dont take ownership of the issue... No empathy or sympathy.... They lack product knowledge...
Depot	I had to keep contacting support because the support ticket website was not being updated regularly. Staff regularly had updates that weren't on the website. I received the email about the replacement part(s) being out of stock about 7-10 days after support told me that update, and the day after receiving the email is when I received the email saying the repairs were complete and my laptop was being mailed back to me
Contact Center	Lenovo System update is missing drivers on P320 Tiny. Lenovo support has not been able explain why Lenovo System update is not delivering all missing drivers on Lenovo ThinkStation P320 Tiny after machine has been installed from a Windows 10 1709 media. After install from media + running Lenovo System update the machine is missing 5 drivers in Device Manager.
Onsite	faulty part received.
Onsite	Do not quibble over warranties, supply technicians with correct parts to avoid repeat visits.
Carry In / Walk - In	Already passed 1 month and I still haven't get reply on the battery claim feedback. I not sure need to wait untill when for the replacement battery to arrive. It's kinda "burning" the warranty period.
Carry In / Walk - In	Try to direct talk to consumer and ask about suggestion and feedback . wish to them on their happiest day like birthday ,  anniversary etc.
Onsite	The wrong part was sent
Onsite	Offer me the chance to upgrade parts when you are going to ship and maybe install a new part in my machine.  You all sent me a new HDD and I would have liked to be able to updated that "old" technology to a newer SSD drive.
Depot	Better clarity on status, better customer service (selected English but only give service in German) better alignment (call in service knows nothing of status), faster service (now waiting more than a month with no prohected fix date)
Onsite	Lenovo should send the quality and correct parts. Onsite Technicians are awesome but Lenovo need to improve the process.
Onsite	Get the part in sooner
Onsite	Shorter wait times on the phone, more communication about the status of parts.
Contact Center	As I face the issue of slow performance, to mentain my system taken several times and I have to wait 2-3 hours every time that is the drawback.  It should be resolved as soon as possible.It affect on on daily work ..
Agent	I literally had a single auto generated email telling me to restart the computer with no real way to follow up.
Onsite	Better resolution communication between call center and on site personnel,
Contact Center	Faster pick up times and less waiting time.
Carry In / Walk - In	Speed and the updates that add on to it
Contact Center	a bit more communication and updates.
Onsite	Correct manufacturing parts properly
Onsite	If technical support is also extended during weekends, at least on Saturdays, it would be more helpful
Depot	computer was never returned to me
Onsite	Send out the correct parts the first time. Also send out the parts to the correct destination rather than allowing the parts to end up at a dead end UPS store in a city 45 minutes away that only allows pickups and won't continue to deliver the package to the destination.
Onsite	i have got report that call is completed without my signature and seal who signed that report ? without my knowledge?
Onsite	Send the correct part for my laptop the first time
Onsite	Laptop's part that is sent to customer is damaged so please check cautionly
Depot	Expedite return process is will be better.
Onsite	Provide assistance to the field techs, in particular Leo. He was outstanding with his support, timeliness and diligence.Glad to work with him.
Onsite	Solve the full problem, not the partial one,
Onsite	May be the chat support can stop asking unnecessary questions for a simple issue like failed USB port and quickly move on with part replacement.
Onsite	Improve the quality of the product as to reduce service calls, Have the necessary parts on hand and if parts are not available send a replacement.  Quality test the parts...Make sure the right part gets sent out, that was a problem.  Techs are not sent out in a timely fashion, It is apparent that there are staffing issues with the third party repair services you use.
Onsite	give clear knowledege about the warrenty and gaurentee of diffrent parts....
Agent	Make it easier to find support.Know their own products instead of reading from a default script.Not rudely hang up on customers because they are incompetent and no product training and expertise.Must be tech savvy.Must be customer friendly and show empathy.Remove the familiar fob off, i.e. FAQ and Forums that screams "Screw You" to customers.Provide a "Technical" "Support" service.
Contact Center	tech support phone number was incorrect on web.  when I engaged with chat service, they were sales only and were very unhelpful.  Better advertise the number for tech support for Yoga
Depot	Give your techs access to whats going on with the product, they literally would have to leave chat for 5-10 minutes to get any kind of update which seemed to change every day so I question the integrity of where they were receiving information-_-
Contact Center	I was confused because after I had already told the system to call me now, it asked if I wanted to schedule a call. The first time I tried to do this, I changed my mind and tried to schedule one instead, but I don't think you can at that point. Otherwise, it was great!
Onsite	We still get same error after tech left
Carry In / Walk - In	return the computer functioning
Carry In / Walk - In	Taken so much of time, as well technical person not understand battery issue
CRU	Wrong part was shipped to me
Onsite	Better service on the phone I got shifted around in a circle, was not given updates
Contact Center	I was waiting to speak with the technical help longer than I spoke to him. At least 25 minutes waiting. Only to be told to check things I had already doneBe more knowledgeable than the client or to be able to gain access to knowledge quickly.
Contact Center	I await Lenovo's advice but have tried at the wrong times!
Depot	Fix the unit properly would be nice
Contact Center	The sound quality on the receiving end of the call was absolutely dreadful. I don't fault the tech support person at all for this. You're obviously using a voip integrated system (maybe a PBX) and it sounds like a garbage fyi
Contact Center	Need to call back and provide information
Onsite	how about getting to the repair faster than two weeks?
Onsite	Your third party engineers is not talented.
Onsite	Improve the service response time and accuracy of determining the part that needs to be ordered.
Onsite	Get the parts availability in the site warehouse
Onsite	Direct and faster contact with technical team with minimum time.
Onsite	Arrange replacement part as soon as possible
Onsite	Technicians should not expect person requiring service to be an IT professional
Agent	Need follow up support
Onsite	I bought a Legion in September 2018 and when I tried to do the school project work the display is not working.After complaining daily one in service person will come home,they must have opened everything 1000 times and changed Mother board,LCD display,Cable and so on.I asked them to replace my laptop with a new one because what is left in a laptop other than these parts.But in vain.Now I have that all spare part changed laptop which I don't know how long it will work.Hard earned money (1 lakh)is wasted.Very poor service.Never ever going to buy a lenovo,I will warn my friends and family not to go for Lenovo products.
Onsite	Improve your warranty support service - particularly, the accessibility of booking a service appointment.
Onsite	The customer care executive should understand that customer is not a technician or computer Engineer , as they ask so many technical question . I am thankful to service center person who really help me a lot while i was talking to customer care mam/ sir.
Depot	Again, not a 0 because of the people I got in contact via chat tried to help as much as they could, but the delay and CERO update either online of via e-mail. I sent once an e-mail and I never got a response, also not a 0 because I own other Lenovo products that've worked great
Contact Center	improve waiting time
Contact Center	Bought through Costco, their tech support was unable to solve the problem, seemed like they could have transferred it to Lenovo much sooner.
Depot	Machine return packaging was very bad. Some foam and machine loose. Machine could move when handled. Bad-Bad
Depot	Bad communication update. Bad call service
CRU	Better review of diagnostics for the proper part to be shipped out; follow up on issue that it has been resolved before closing off the ticket
Contact Center	provide advice or update software so that i can use the fingerprint access.  Even after the recent Lenovo 'update' which purportedly addressed fingerprint issues, i still cannot access the computer using the fingerprint touch 'pad'
CRU	First representative on the phone couldn't understand me, and I could not understand them for the most part.  Correct part was requested, shipping department sent the wrong part.  Double checking that the correct part is in the box would be helpful, RFID on each part would help eliminate this human error.
Onsite	Lenovo should train their technical representative.
Contact Center	Lenovo has not responded to this call, no engineer has called me. So, to improve, Lenovo can actually provide support.
Depot	Make a product that doesn't need repaired 3 times in a year
Contact Center	Better phone service, quicker and easier.
Contact Center	provide some follow up service, email or call to make sure customer's problem is solving. If problem persists, shall continue to investigate/
Contact Center	It wasn't fixed you tried to charge me for a warranty repair
Contact Center	1. respond to my emails2. don't close the ticket after one working day3, actually deal with my issue - you've done nothing
Onsite	Ensure spare parts are sent to maintenance technician rather than customer.
Carry In / Walk - In	please update it with current software
Carry In / Walk - In	Because the repair workshop was far to slow and expensive
Carry In / Walk - In	I am sure when I bought this product on Lazada, that this product comes with warranty with on-site visit. When I found problems with my wifi after I received this product, the customer service officer told me on the phone that the warranty does not have on-site visit. I am baffled why this can happen. Also, the technical support staff could not address my wifi problems and kept giving me irrelevant advice (for more than 1 week!). If they are really competent, they should have been able to zero in and find the source of the problem (which was a faulty wifi card) and arrange to fix my problem straightaway. The technical support staff were behaving just like telephone operators reading from a standard manual which annoys me greatly.
Depot	faster repair time
CRU	If I was supposed to return the old charger there was no instructions on how to do that. It would also be good to have support for software working with the hardware, for instance the usb ports and headphone jack don't work with certain programs but I have updated all drivers on everything and have the latest versions of the software. the headphone jack has never worked well with skype on this lenovo laptop, but hasn't been an issue on any other laptop I have had. It would be nice to have easier access to calling the right support team, it is very hard to find the number to call on your website.
Contact Center	My charger  not working , was refused another.
Depot	Give more regular updates.
Depot	Call me and provide update on status, dont completely disable machine so it no longer works at all.
Onsite	better service from all your support staff as some have very limited tech knowledge and takes an hour to get to level 2
Onsite	Give the engineer the correct spare part.
Onsite	Be more professional in timeliness and follow-through.
Depot	Once the laptop was returned it me it started having new issues
Depot	Don't replace a motherboard when it's unnecessary, especially if it will result in deleting all my data and taking three weeks to return. Even more so when you are aware I have no access to the data to back it up.
Contact Center	Decrease background noise
Onsite	Not close out a service request and then make me have to call again to wonder where the part is after a week
Depot	make the repair process a little faster
Onsite	Order the correct parts the first time
Onsite	Advising and issuing of correct part in initial phonecall
Carry In / Walk - In	After doing system update,phone was not working properly, became slow n sluggish, sites were not opening properly,download slow,. at service centre, they put me again on previous  Version, n formats my phone again i have to download all Apps required,  After 2-3 days again it start misbehaving, this time-touch was not working, again I went at service centre, again they said Software issues, they done things, but this time all my important Videos, gone. They r not saying to take backups, or Help how take backups,just taking phone inside, n do the job, telling software issues.If this phone has not capacity,  toUpgrade Version. Y send UPDATE . Unnecessary bothering, n lost many important files.due to this software issues.Pl. Make phone, strong first n then ,Ask to go for Upgrade.  Hope next time I want be bothered by your  So called Phone Software issues.     Yours truly           Chetan Zaveri
Onsite	Train your Customer Service Representatives, particularly someone called Victoria to be Professional and Courteous.
Onsite	AMC Renewal not updated properly it very bad experience from Lenovo
Onsite	Please teach the lenovo technical staff communication skills. The person named Rupesh asked me to repair my laptop with a safety pin when I was in my office. This situation was extremely embarrassing and annoying.
Depot	Have more space on  the inventory form for the fields that have to be written in.Offer pre-paid shipping label.
Onsite	Not crash the bios when doing a bios update.
Carry In / Walk - In	Even for hardware issues, the troubleshooting not start from software update. For my issue the phone was not getting ON cause of battery issue as it had bulge. By default you should not do factory reset which will cause data loss of customer. Very Dissatisfied with the troubleshooting process. Because of this customer has to face issue of data loss !!!!!
Depot	Give me updates on why it was taking so long
Onsite	Better communication about the arrival of parts. I received a call that parts were available and scheduled a time with the tech. Then I received another call that parts were not actually available, and to cancel the scheduled time. The parts actually arrived a day later.
Contact Center	Fix the timley manner over the phone to how quick you connect to a repersentitave.
Depot	Solve the problem, the computer was returned with working software but no audio. Also the fingerprint reader would not work. The chat person was patient and helpful but the end result is no sound. He also said he would send more information but I have received no information. The audio does not work and this is a real concern
Carry In / Walk - In	I have not yet received my laptop.do something about it.
Depot	Provide more information regarding resolution to issue.
Contact Center	The service request ticket was not made until a week after I called for technical support. Then, the parts shipped to the on site technician were not the correct parts for my computer.
Onsite	provide tested part avoid DOA parts.
Onsite	Lack of seriousness & unprofessional approach
Onsite	better diagnosis over the phone so technician would bring enough parts to test
Contact Center	Warranty issue required mailing system back and forth, technician also provided info on walk in warranty service near me which is ongoing waiting for a part
Agent	Frustrating experience to have, but the agent knew how to handle it - and listened to me when I explained what I had already attempted. It was a nice change of pace, to have a service agent listen and engage.
Onsite	send the mail regarding regestering the complaint and details of the parts status and engineer arriving status like dell services.
Contact Center	Answer the telephone.
Onsite	bring more technical staff to solve problems.
Contact Center	little difficult to understand how to make it to the right servive rep through phone options,
Contact Center	still awaiting refund
Contact Center	The person on the other end of the phone was hard to understand.
Onsite	Part delivery was very slow, no proper update provided by call center and Service center
Carry In / Walk - In	returned phone with no battery and no back case
Carry In / Walk - In	After several complain still haven't got the resolution.very harassing and pathetic service provider
CRU	Maybe not the fault of the support, but did not have the part in the database to send me. Needed a 16gb memory stick, instead I got 8GB x 2.
Onsite	Quicker resolution time
Onsite	Providing better parts..
Carry In / Walk - In	I wanted to add more details of the problem but reply to service email is not acknowledged. This wasted a lot of time in communication.
Depot	I was using the portal to try to contact the depot for updates on my repair, but received ZERO responses for the two months my machine was being repaired. I attempted to call support for an update, but was transferred around until my called was dropped multiple times. I contacted support through the live chat and once again was transferred from agent to agent until my session was dropped. An overall terrible experience with support.
Onsite	i had received brand new lap top but having the display issue, I don't know where QC department can test the laptop or not
Contact Center	Include the "Lenovo Tablet" as a product option on the automated telephone help line, instead of expecting a customer to know that their Lenovo product should be referred to as an "Idea" product.
Contact Center	offer a solution to the recall that i can work with.
Contact Center	Get with Microsoft to not have issues with sound, so that I don't have to call after a Windows 10 update - this has happened twice.
Contact Center	Had an issue with the microphone about 2 months after purchasing that needed to be repaired.  This time it was an issue with the speakers.  Just hoping this laptop is not a lemon.
Onsite	This is the second time not fixed the issue but close the case. I believe at least fix before close case, right?
Onsite	to be blunt, I didn't like that I had to escalate the ticket at least more than twice before a Lenovo technician was sent out. Feel not enough communication - technician's never came twice as arranged and there was no warning or notification regarding that.
Onsite	still issue not resolved, So why we getting feedback form.I'm not satisfied with your support.
Onsite	make the delivery of part little faster
Onsite	was a delay as part out of stock
Onsite	Suggested solution was not successful & Still waiting for a part
Onsite	Do not wait until there is a problem to let the customer know if a part/service is going to be delayed.  Communicate within 24 hours the current status of the ticket and why it is so.
Depot	Repair a unit when it first comes in
Contact Center	Shorter wait times on the phone.
Onsite	Initial investigation to confirm the issue is related to hardware took more than expected time and while replacing part the part brought was defective and there is no spare, again delayed by some time. better if the replacing part is prechecked and also it would be helpfull to bring spare piece.
Contact Center	Make the waiting time shorter. I have had to wait a month for the process of a return to go through and I havent even received my refund yet.
Onsite	Deliver on time. Deliver replacement parts that fit.
Onsite	Tech has not shown up multiple times, wrong part, waiting for new part (3 times now).
Onsite	Listn customer feedback while  log call
Contact Center	Instead of calling me to tell me I need to go open another ticket because it was opened incorrectly - there should be a way to transfer the ticket to another group.
Contact Center	Problem was very slow response,  time > 1 minute to simple commands when using MS Office 365 Apps and PDF Editor by Tracker Software. It was ameliorated by reloading the apps, which was quite time-consuming. It would help if this issue & the fix was published as a FAQ.
Onsite	respond to my messages, make customer service accessible, not tell me that they will send a repair tech to me and then NEVER DO SO, not send me to pick up spare parts, hold my laptop and never mail it back to me, putting a open ticket on my laptop for a technician that never came and then blocking the repair company from repairing my laptop because I needed to cancel this ticket for a repair that never occured
Contact Center	It has been too horrible to recall.
Onsite	The contractor you sent was rushing and seemed a bit disorganized as he set up to take my Lenovo apart, he knocked over my big screen scratching my very nice wood desk and putting a nice black mark down my wall. He dropped screws and found them fortunately but when he put my computer back together he did not get the screws in tight enough so they scratch my desk. I dont have the tools to tighten the screws so I keep a towel under it so not to continue to scratch my desk. He installed the new hard drive and informed me that I may lose my information as I had no way of backing it up due to the blue screen of death. I told him to take it out and I would work with someone else to fix it. So sadly I was not impressed. My computer is now working without any further technical help so I sent the new hard drive back to you.
Agent	The agent did not ask if I had registered my device before saying that I would need to. The agent reacted poorly for me not knowing good troubleshooting steps for the device not turning on at all. After that, they did walk me through some steps that I did not consider which did restore functionality.
Onsite	the engineer change wrong part and no follow up even after I had called the hotline twice.
Carry In / Walk - In	WAY faster then expected also didn't expect a brand new replacement I expected hers to be fixed or a refurbished one sent.
Contact Center	No repairs were made, technician broke the laptop eventually, waiting for a replacement 2nd week without a laptop, delivery date changes everyday
Carry In / Walk - In	Infact product was received in damaged condition. Defect was noticed only in a few hours. However, intead of replacement I was forced to note that it was damaged by self mishandling.
Onsite	Just need to improve local service support from Local Technician side.......They are need to be more punctual in time schedule.
Depot	website did not give timely updates. i had to call three different days to get updates. my computer was confirmed to be delivered to your site by UPS but your site did not show that for more than a week. the return slip with my computer had some words about what was done to it but i could not understand what was done. also, the outside protector to the screen does not sit right so it is not closed...how do i remedy that?
Onsite	Get the Lenovo support house in order.Absolutely dismal performance.On 21 June I opened the ticket as the camera in my X1 Carbon 5th gen stopped working.Since that time I spent 7 1/2 days at home waiting for an engineer,An engineer came - after about 3 weeks' wait, and replaced the camera. No change.I went away for a week, and on return had a couple of conversations with a manager from the Front Office team - this was such a relief, after futile conversations with the front office staff: those men and women, when I rang asking where's the promised engineer, began by saying 'oh, yes, the engineer is going to come today', a couple of minutes later switching to 'oh no, the part is not yet ready; he will come day after tomorrow'. Mr  De Eccher was very kind, and said the next step would be replacing the cable.I was expecting a technician on Monday; no one rang (only once before the engineer kindly rang in the morning).The engineer rang the next afternoon (Tuesday) saying I am on my way to you - but I was not at home.On Wednesday the original time of the visit has slipped, and I needed to leave. Agreed for a visit next afternoon after 2 pm.Today the engineer rang in the morning, as agreed, and came in the afternoon. But when he opened the box which was prepared for the job, there was nothing apart from a new bezel. So no part, no repair. Since the team in Bulgaria has gone home by that time, so I must be looking forward (after over 5 weeks' wait!) for another visit next Monday (that is, if I am lucky!)
Onsite	lenovo executives on phone are just unbelievably horrible...they have zero knowledge and they took nearly an entire day to document a simple issue...however, the person who visited ibm campus is an amazing guy..he knows in and out of the hardware issues..such a remarkable difference between the call centre guys and the ones at the site..there is still a pending problem though...battery is not replaced yet..will appreciate if you can extend help..
Onsite	Send the engineer with buffer time so that we can properly check the issue and update. Site timing is 7 AM to 3 PM which is already updated to engineer many times and also CC while logging the case, still engineer arrives at 2.30 PM-2.45 PM, replaced the system board and left the site. When we checked and called again to engineer he had gone very far. Next time engineer send one boy after 2 days. If engineer arrives with buffer time issue could have been resolved on the same day.
Onsite	Next day support means next day, not 3 days to get parts and then 2 more days to get the tech onsite. Also, sending a tech who is not weird would be nice. Hire people who are personable and happy.
Contact Center	During my call the line was disconnected.  I waited to see if the centre would call back.  When I realised they were not going to, I called again; sadly I had to go through everything again.  The service was fine, but its frustrating when you have all my details that nobody called me back to complete the registration.
Depot	Return all of the components returned for service.  The battery was not returned.  I called and got another order Order Number : 407BB2WTracking Number:  Request No: 407BB2W-01 Part No: 00NY493, WB#: 1Z3Y946E0308594912 But UPS doesn't know anything about this tracking number.  So I have a fixed laptop with no battery.
Onsite	Better trained and knowledgeable staff
Depot	They replaced my screen but failed to install the camera, when I noticed an hour in and called the number I was given, I was bounced from department to department for 75 minutes, and finally I had to ship my computer in again to get fixed under warranty.  I was so frustrated that my computer was not fixed and being on the phone for 75 minutes that I did not have much fight in me to argue that you missed something in the repair and that it should not matter if the repair was warranty eligible, especially when you messed up the repair.  I have been telling everyone I know about the bad customer service and to stay away from buying a Lenovo.
Contact Center	Not close the the ticket and make me call back to open another one.
Depot	Live tracking of the parcel and its whereabouts.
Depot	Still waiting for unit to be fixed and returned.
Depot	Everything opposite of what you did. By far the worst communication over the phone we've ever had (all five times) When we sent back the unit other than not working, it was in mint condition. Can't say that now.
Onsite	Not lose the spare part :)
Onsite	don't send damaged or DOA parts
Onsite	When we pay for next business day support, we expect to get next business day support.  Many times it is because the part is not in stock.  If we are paying for NBD support the parts should be in stock.
Onsite	Stand by more relevant parts for onsite support
Onsite	The first time my laptop required service this year it took nearly two weeks for a resolution as measured against a next-business-day SLA. This time I called in the issue on a Monday, the part shipped and arrived in my area by EOD Tuesday, but it was still midday Thursday before the tech finished installation of the new motherboard. Might need more qualified Lenovo techs in the New England region.
Onsite	First, please improve your service quality, today almost 1.5 months completed but without any resolution you came for survey, as on date my complain is pending.
Carry In / Walk - In	Issue was not resolved and customer support hotline personnel is extremely unprofessional and rude.
Onsite	Lenovo needs to have the technicians bring the part to the customer instead of shipping the part to the customer.  Lenovo told me that shipped me the part, however, the part never came.  After running around my office and the technician researching it as well, it was determined that Lenovo shipped to a Lenovo parts center.  It was a delay of about 45 minutes...Not too bad, but the technician should have brought it in the first place.  The technician did a great job and I have nothing but praise for him.  Thank you.
Carry In / Walk - In	The device I received is faulty.
Carry In / Walk - In	Faster technical support follow up
Onsite	Stop killing my machines with BIOS updates.  On two high end Lenovo workstations I've had you replace motherboards for their 4 times in three years.  You've lost all possible profit on those machines and spend a lot of my time.  Which I'd like to charge you for.
Depot	I waited almost 2 months to receive my laptop back after sending it out for a relatively simple issue, so improving service time would be positive. Also, I called twice to change the return address for my laptop, and spoke with a representative each time, but it was still returned to the wrong address.
Onsite	Please arrange the parts at the as earliest
Carry In / Walk - In	please update you chat services better, it would connect most of the time. In case there is a delay in the service an update to the customer will be appreciated!!
Onsite	improve on call answering times, providing timely updates on fixes and issues, provide updates from engineer, provide updates on when an engineer is meant to come on an onsite visit and not just turn up
Contact Center	improve your phone system it took me half hour to get through the phone
Contact Center	Never made the connection to meet I had to go out of town and kept trying to call the guy to called me he never picked up
Carry In / Walk - In	I didn't get the feedback on first day as promised. Technical people could not explain what might be reason for batter burning. Charging is very slow.
Onsite	Improve communication, keep better track of tickets and parts.
Onsite	Your tech never showed up and no I have to replace the part myself.
Onsite	Better training for techniciansBetter availability of replacement partsImprove clarity of information on support cases
Carry In / Walk - In	Still awaiting return of device
Depot	Meet warranty turn around times. I dont purchase expedited depot warranties to wait 4 weeks. Proactively update part status, and proactively replace machines that wont have parts available in a reasonable amounts of time. Improve communication between repair depot and first line support.
Onsite	please provide all hardware parts serial number to vendor or to users, while logging a complain we face lot of issue as serial number of HDD  is not matching with current laptop .in our company we have not replaced and any parts of laptop as all laptops in  under warranty.
Contact Center	waiting for a address label as promised when i said could not print one
Onsite	More communication about part availability, it shouldn't take a month to get a corporate workstation back to full functionality, there should have been a full system swap before that
Onsite	Maybe a little more training to allow the engineer to update the bios on the motherboards using the download option.
Onsite	onsite service engineer should be more professional
CRU	I was sent a hard drive to replace myself (can't even get the casing of the computer open) so I'm unable to repair on my own. I was told diagnostics were run on the computer by a customer service rep but don't know how that is possible. I thought my warranty was supposed to include on-site technician repair but instead was sent a device to replace on my own. The instructions that came with it were extremely limited. The warranty on my computer has expired because of course I began to experience issues at the end of the warranty period. I'm disappointed in my experience with Lenovo because I've heard such good things about service in the past. My experience could be improved with additional support in fixing or replacing my machine.
Onsite	when the customer service ordered the wrong part it delayed the resolution.  They sent me a cable when nvme drives connect strait to the motherboard.
Contact Center	Still waiting for a reply on when replacement will be
Onsite	provide spare parts which could be moounted fe. displays
Depot	Disappointing that the ac adapter (that was sent in at Lenovo's insistence) was not returned with the machine, resulting in the loss of an extra 3 days of being able to re load everything and catch up on work.
Depot	Use a better courier, trust your third party repair partners' judgement with diagnosis, to prevent repeated visits.
Onsite	It took a long time to get routed to the correct department. Please try and simplify your automated call system.
Depot	Took too long on delivery of parts
Carry In / Walk - In	It did not take long to receive the replacement.
Carry In / Walk - In	i waited there about 2 hour for just an headset replacement.the customer executive told me to that they need to format the phone for a headset replacement. please appoint person with minimum knowledge in this area.
Contact Center	Advertise this service quotation phone number more.
Onsite	not connected to technical support. I got complent number only.
Onsite	Make sure the technician comes with the right parts the first time.
Onsite	Schedule the repair faster. Be proactive - I had to call Lenovo to check the status of my repair only to find out that the part had arrived. I then waited another 2 days and made one more phone call before a tech contacted me to schedule the service.
Contact Center	Shorten waiting time, have a test run before giving out the laptop
Carry In / Walk - In	Team took about a week to claim that issue is resolved, but in actuals Problem is not resolved and has reoccurred again.
Depot	Better support on your forums, and dont return repaired product that was damaged by the technition working on it.
Depot	carry out proper checks on equipment before returning.
Contact Center	Local support centre to improve communication and solve the problem faster instead of being passed on to different call centres.
Onsite	The person that took the initial Ari need to improve his telephone professionalism. My service Tech was excellent.
Onsite	The first part that was sent was incorrect.  This is a new tablet because the last one broke and there were no parts to replace that one.  Seems like a problem
Contact Center	Place me on your do not contact list.  The daily emails are bothersome. I am not at all satisfied with your product and would never recommend a Lenovo Product to anyone.
Carry In / Walk - In	I had repeated problem with same issue of mic not working, but I had not given a permanent solution.I received.. Repaired mobile on Saturday(24th March 2018)..fourth time. I don't how many days this time it will work
Onsite	The only negative is that your Managed Technical Support Access Site (https://www.managedtechnicalsupportaccess.com/mtsarva/lenovo.html) is clunky to use and looks as if it was designed 25 years ago.
Onsite	Wrong part was ordered and shipped to the technician
Contact Center	Quicker response
Depot	Be certain that the Waybill they send out is trackable and active. I feel lucky my device reached repairs soundly because I was unable to track it with the Waybill after sending it out. This caused me stress.
Depot	Fix the problem the first time so I don't have to return .center for service.   But the representative was very helpful with setting up everything needed to mail my computer to service center.
Agent	reduce hold time
Contact Center	Make it easier to find your phone number, make it quicker to get to the person I need. Don't ask a lot of unnecessary personal questions then pretend it's for my data security
Onsite	Replace original parts
Carry In / Walk - In	They were having lack of knowledge
Onsite	Replacement part took quite a long time to get.  I didn't feel that the BlueTooth board was that hard to get.
CRU	I was told that a replacement hard-drive would be sent out and that an engineer would be in touch to fit it and, I thought,  reinstall Windows etc.I was disappointed when a little later that day I received an e-mail informing me that the item was classed as a CRU which to a non-technical person is not good news.When the replacement hard-drive arrived it came with no instructions other that the link for the  'video' for replacement that had been forwarded to me by e-mail.  That still left me with no idea at all of how to reinstall the basic Lenovo and Windows software to get the thing working.  Today I received a USB stick with that software and helpful printed instructions.  Now all I have to do is to find the time to do the replacement and re-installation.
Contact Center	The service said to have to wait for quote and parts to be sent to us about 2 months if its without warranty, the period sounds ridiculous to me. Just expecting customer had to find  other solutions or buy any other brands laptop.
Depot	Keep people more updated and have someone to talk to over the phone easier.
Contact Center	How about more contact on repairs?  I did not know the unit was shipped back and had to look for it.  When shipping, etc.   My experience with HP depot repair is a much for communication friendly experience.
Contact Center	Make contact and allow time for response.
Depot	Send updates on the service to your customer so they know what's going on. My computer was with you for a month and I had to keep checking online to see what the status was. Plus the status description was pretty vague.
Contact Center	I was referred to the website to download a driver or update, but issue is not resolved
Contact Center	waiting for dhl to organize a shipment back to lenovo so i can get a replacement laptop as promised
Onsite	The techs who come onsite should be supplied several parts to resolve possible issues.   If the tech would have had the system board and the keyboard on the second visit it could have been resolved then.  BUT he was only sent the keyboard when it was the system board that was bad.
Depot	Never received email that my laptop had been received. Never received update on diagnosis. Never received update on resolution of issue. Never received updated laptop was on it's way back. Went in for software issue, they replaced hard drive and motherboard. Took a month. If I hadn't called THREE times I still wouldn't know why/what happened. Two times I called I was told your internal system that updat s on ticket progress is down lol
Onsite	look for better third party service provider
Onsite	mistake made due to poor labelling made on lenovos part
Onsite	the part wasn't available took a few weeks to make it available
Carry In / Walk - In	There should be proper updates regarding repair status and should be faster
Onsite	Just be honest, acknowledge when you sold a faulty machine and take your responsibility and replace it. I would recommend my friends and colleagues not to purchase a Lenovo, and I will never again bought one. I'm a computer engineer student, I think your laptops are not bad, but the way you handle the machines with issues are very bad, and so in the future I'm gonna try to work with other manufacturer machines.
Depot	Charger was not returned with laptop
Agent	Do whatever you can to improve the connection quality so I can understand  the customer service agents, the think they were Filipinos.
Onsite	Dont lose spare part
Depot	Taking a month to repair, with most of the time spent waiting for parts communicates poor component logistics.
Onsite	Deliver service on time. (I thought maybe a week before service tech came to my house.. Repair was authorize on July 27 and finally last week the technician came out.)
Depot	A faster fix would be great
CRU	Provide installation instructions, and don't require users to replace parts that involve that much effort.
Onsite	you guys can make it more faster in providing spare parts as required.
Depot	parts delivered were incorrect. not tec fault.
Onsite	Ensure that the support team are able to send out the correct parts for the devices.
Onsite	provide more knowledge
Onsite	There was a small initial delay which was caused by the unavailability of spare parts which had to be ordered. Other than that, there were no problems with the service.
Carry In / Walk - In	The replacement phone I received had the same defect as the original one. When you accept the update request to Android 8.0.0, you suddenly stop receiving text messages.
Onsite	returned computer to my IT dept.  Had to get new computer
Onsite	make sure parts are available
Contact Center	Increase the turnaround time between Lenovo agreeing to send an engineer and the engineer contacting the customer to arrange a date and time.
Contact Center	Your so called "BRAND NEW" laptop is even worse than my old laptop which was given to me way back 2007. This ideapad 110 is such a sluggish laptop. Just to open a file explorer take 1 min. It often hang. it is a trash worthy laptop!!
Depot	Keep the status page updated! Almost 2 months went by without a single update, even after calling.
Onsite	Can't ask to improve on it - I contacted on day one, was advised to update drivers, when that failed, was marked for onsite service.  The next day someone comes to my house and within an hour has fixed the issue.  It was about as good an experience as I have ever had with Lenovo and I've always experienced top notch support from Lenovo.
CRU	get part ordered or notify customer if it isnt being shipped.
Onsite	parts availability is very much poor. its worst. poorest
Onsite	If possible to lessen the timeframe of replacement of specific defective equipment parts.
CRU	Clearer support instructions beforehand
Depot	Item is waiting on UPS again as problem reoccured with in the hour and again the following day.
Onsite	The call center shoudl treat each call in a professional manner.  My first request was totally lost but second one went right through.
Onsite	The in-home technician did not actually evaluate the situation, just came to replace parts (which did not solve the problem). Additionally, he received the wrong parts twice but did not check before coming to my house, so ended up having to schedule 4 visits. During the final visit, he was convinced he had already replaced the part he was coming to replace, but he had not (eventually he realized it, but not an enjoyable interaction). The problem is still unresolved.
Onsite	Online support have not update me on my inquiry and was told that they will escalate the case but instead I've gotten a survey form.
Onsite	nothing in particular. Great service all the way around.
Onsite	Have a better appontment and parts arrangement
Onsite	waiting for parts
Onsite	the repair took approximately 20 days but it was over Christmas  and the wrong part was delivered so it required a second visit. I was not too worried but if the PC wasn't functioning I'd not be so relaxed
Contact Center	Need to be more accurate when setting the appointments, we agreed on one date on the phone, and got the appointment of one day earlier.
Onsite	send multiple parts to cover the possibility of the issue.
Depot	First I was told they were waiting on a part, then I was told that the issue was not covered
Onsite	shorter wait time for parts
Contact Center	Better English language skills, perhaps a better phone system which improves the audibility - sometimes the phone conversation is impossible simply because the line quality is appalling.
CRU	Better instructions
Onsite	It is unfair that a software update is necessary within 15 days of purchase.
Depot	Fix your website to accommodate typos - in other words, give a user an opportunity to look over the info typed in before processing.  The whole need to call and have someone handle the return by phone taking up tons of my valuable time was because of a typo I didn't realize I had done.
Depot	Train your front-line staff around warranty procedures outside the USA.Provide a shipping label that allows the shipper to pick up the package from me, rather than having me drop it off at their depot.
Onsite	My only issue with Lenovo as far as calling in for warranty repairs, is having to call in multiple times when I have multiple machines in need of repair. The company that I work for has a large scale Lenovo laptop fleet and even though it's rare, there are times when the same component on multiple similar models will fail. It's just an overall hassle to make multiple calls and go through the automated prompts, then wait for a support associate as it eats up a good portion of an hour to call in two or three systems.
Onsite	I didn't receive email updates on when the engineer was going to visit - would have been good to know so I could ensure someone was available
Onsite	I expected a faster response time to the onsite repair.
Carry In / Walk - In	when i purchased new laptop its right side num keys was not working and i visited at your service center, they told me this is because of old software so we have to update new window. they done it and my key start working but now my system is start hanging too much. I do not know what they done in software.When i purchased new system why you did not checked before delivery that keys are not working.  I am very much upset from Lenovo that my new system I am tacking at service center and even it is not working more bad.
Depot	Explain how to package the Laptop for return shipping. The video it refers you to is not there.
Agent	product transaction, customer care, HW service AND SW service are all disconnected...it makes for a very difficult customer experience...you all are in the tech business, yet your tech can't adequately support the customer's need. Yes my issue may have gotten done, but only through adamant self-advocacy and escalation. So much time and angst to solve the fact that my wifi wouldn't work on a brand new machine...and in the end you couldn't solve it and still wanted to bill the customer for a portion of a two hour old service contract that wasn't necessary according to your own SME to begin with. I love the product but this company is suffering from "the cobbler's kids have no shoes" syndrome. Sad, i couldn't even provide a grade there were so many variables to the experience.
Onsite	properly communicate delays that were caused by Lenovo service staff errors, allow for more transparency in the process, reduce the amount of times a customer has to call in to get the product repaired, don't bullshit customers with excuses when they call to check the status of the repair.
Depot	The service was too slow, and I didn't get a replacement PC whilw mine was being repaired, although I needed it for work (programming)
Onsite	Wrong part sent and tech did not check that all laptop functions were working.
Carry In / Walk - In	put zero dollars down and received a replacement in a few days
Contact Center	No contact or solution was provided.
Carry In / Walk - In	My accidental warranty confirmation not received till now. Hardware quality is not good. Hard drive crashed within 1 month.
Contact Center	It was a while back now and hard to remember but contact me sooner.
Contact Center	I called about a specific error and was told I needed to completely reformat my computer (recovery disk) the actual problem was a harddrive failure. The support person had me read all of the information from the BIOS to them and failed to realize from the error message and from the BIOS information that my harddrive had failed.
Onsite	Send the correct part for the device on the first try
Carry In / Walk - In	RepresentativeIssue resolution
Onsite	Don't tell me the part is indefinitely backordered then call my customer the next day to schedule service. Was the part backordered or not?!?
Depot	Laptop sent back to Kentucky 2 times now, and still not returned back to me.
Depot	Shorten the time to return
Onsite	Faulty part has been replaced but the software has not been isntalled
Depot	We like the speed of the laptop, but having it in the repair depot 3 times in the first six months is unreasonable.
Onsite	Prefer to resolve all technical issues during technician come onsite.
Onsite	Not ship broken parts to me multiple times.
Depot	Fix the issue that was the cause of us sending the unit to you and send back a working unit.
Contact Center	Faster response to complaints
Onsite	Improve the skills of the first call handler, she did not have good enough spoken english to grasp the problem or what I had already done to resolve the issue myself, became a somewhat circular discussion
Onsite	Faster parts despatch for common parts would be helpful. Lenovo has nothing over Dell for speed and efficiency of getting parts sent to the technician.
Onsite	maintain service time to provide technical support
Onsite	Send the right part and have a have a technician sent in a more timely fashion
Onsite	Please resolve issues completely and deploy knowledgeable and qualified personnel for service
Onsite	Don't send out a tech with the wrong part after I've already waited a week
Contact Center	The person on the phone was unable to make the repair. They scheduled a technician, then closed the request. It's been 2 weeks and no one has contacted. My computer is not repaired. I called a 2nd time after 10 days. Again the repair has been forgotten. The warranty upgrade has been an absolute waste out money.
Onsite	Very difficult i was facing some issues after 2-3 months i bought the laptop also there was a manufacturing defect i wrote to india head he is just arguing me not resolving my issue at all he sent a technician who checked and wrote on paper that it should be get replaced and he is ordering that part but later ur company refused
Onsite	On -Site Technician visited on Sat Sept 29th - the part he received was damaged / dented on both sides - so he could not use it.  As of Oct 11th, after making  multiple follow up phone calls and new Service tickets (for the same issue) being opened  by the Help Desk  team each time i have reached out - I am still being told that the parts are on order and were supposed to be delivered to the on site technician Oct 10th. The laptop is being used by my daughter for school, and it's very frustrating for her not to have functioning key board  and to be waiting almost 15 days for the issue to be fixed since the issue was first reported.
Contact Center	It was very hard to navigate through the automated call system. I had to be transferred multiple times, and given different phone numbers to call. finally, I used the web site to get a call back instead of waiting on hold, then having to be transferred again.
Onsite	lack of updates on portal necessitating ringing the helpline to move things along.
CRU	Ensure to send the correct part.
Contact Center	Actually fix my issue and when you say your going to call me back, actually call me back.
Onsite	Keep parts in local warehouse
Onsite	Carry more parts. Bring the correct part instead of nickeling and diming it
Onsite	Didn't realize they were shipping the part to my location
Contact Center	Fix the update BIOS issues. Not have tech agents advise to just ignore it
Onsite	Its highly disappointing to see that it takes almost two weeks for Lenovo to order and replace a part.
Agent	Staff was rude and condescending
Onsite	Adhere to contract and send out engineers on time without having to chase you up
Depot	online status update is terrible and does not provide any information of value. would have liked to know exact stages of repair timeline (ie. received, repairs in progress, preparing for shipment, shipped). would also liked to have known what problem was found and repaired on unit.
Depot	In the initial contact with support the incompatible memory was to be returned with the computer ... it was not
Onsite	Better communication / This is the first time they called for supportSupport initially gave standard service, then realized it was Premier so the process took longer The technician was 2-3 hours late with no call to inform of the delay Do not require a call back, only notice the feedback for improvement.
Carry In / Walk - In	When me and Verizon called them I told them that FedEx in my area where sloppy and nasty so I told them that they would need to get a signature required for the package the Motorola representative on the phone insured us that they would have a signature required for the package but they never put it on there so I don't know who FedEx gave my phone to but it sure as hell wasn't me and to top it off Motorola nasty because they're still trying to make me pay money for the phone when I never received it so no I'm not satisfied at all I am very very dissatisfied
Depot	Better return information by email. Send a box to send laptop back in.
Contact Center	My one month old laptop was just recalled-  Lenovo leaves it to me to take a day off work to go 40 miles out of my way, to drop off and have to go back another day- because loose screws could cause it to combust.  Your service person could NOT give me the phone number of the authorized repair place in Los Angeles. The address on Lenovo's site was incorrect for YOUR authorized repair place. Basically LENOVO has done absolutely nothing nothing nothing to help me
CRU	Dont take several days to send the wrong part. Dont take 3 days to send a laptop box. Dont take 7 days to repair. I. Have been without my computer for a month with another wee to 10 days to go
Onsite	This comment is not referring to this particular case. It would be great if you could confirm with us that the PC will need to be sent back to you for repairs before actually booking the courier.
Onsite	told to install an update but not wich update
Onsite	At times i felt as though Susan, the rep was calling too frequently, she made it sounds like this was extremely urgent to schedule which put me under a bit of stress given i was out of the office while she wanted to schedule the repair. I wouldn't put the blame on her, it sounded like the lenovo process required an immediate follow up.
Onsite	Keep more spare parts on the ready
Depot	Make a better product and don't force customers to pay for shipping to return your faulty hardware.
Depot	provide a new unit via advanced exchange for DOA units.
Contact Center	I'm guessing I just got that one defective system that happens every now and then but in almost 15 years of Lenovo products this is the first time I hesitate to suggest the products because EVERYTHING basically failed in my laptop. It boils down to customer service not being helpful, making the problems worse, and the system being what I can only assume is defective from the start. The problems I've had and the service makes me hesitant to continue recommending.
Contact Center	I am still waiting for my tablet to be returned
Onsite	Right parts
Depot	to provide part delivery laser time
Contact Center	Answer the phone quicker
Onsite	Show up and put the part in.
Depot	better delivery times of requested parts by technician to the technician
Contact Center	Employ staff who know what they are doing and can book a collection and save me calling 3 times
Contact Center	Slow in response, and managed to send me a downgraded model. Maybe it is due to availability, the replacement (PF0Y70YX) is not vPro certified, and the item in this survey PF0VGCD8 is indeed. The agent managed to send a docking station to make up this downgrade, implicitly. This brings the satisfaction from 1 to 5.
Depot	fix phone headsets so employees and speak louder at times.
Onsite	Despatch correct unrefurbished parts in one go. Send  Competent technicians ..
Depot	Our laptop was returned with issues (not working). Have been trying to get through tech support. Minimum hold time is 30 minutes before I have to hang up, as I am a full time working parent. Very frustrating.
CRU	Check the parts be for you ship them
Onsite	Provide an update on the call 1 to 4 days in without us having to chase.
Onsite	I called the number given by the retailer and apparently it is a marketing department which is not a place to seek for help about technical issues. They asked me to call another number which I find unnecessary as they can just direct my call to the department. I hope that I can receive help earlier than before.
Contact Center	By cutting down the waiting time to speak to someone from customer services
Contact Center	Less wait time on phone
Contact Center	keep the user posted with the status update, the is no update when assets been taken back for repair.
Onsite	improve your systems and technical support
Onsite	Clean up your systems so the various call center people can tell if a part is available and on the way.  Notify customers of progress.  I never  did get emails that were promised after talking to your rep.
Contact Center	Glad it was so simple, hopefully this does not recur. I like the short wait for a person to answer.
Depot	You can return my computer to me sooner.   I spoke with the Tech who said he was finished with it.  It took 2 more weeks to get it to me.  I'm thankful to have it back working fine, but it was a hardship to be without it.  Several of my calls to your customer support group did little or nothing to speed up the return of my computer.
Agent	Provide solution at one go if possible and not to follow up again and again for the same issue.
Depot	Fix my laptop and return my phone calls.  I called the day after I received the Thinkpad back and left a message with technical support for someone to call me back.  No one did.  The computer is not fixed.
Depot	Issue was never resolved - behaved exactly the same when it was returned.
Contact Center	Direct call to customer support require not Chat process with Executive
Contact Center	fix the windows drivers so that when windows updates it does not disable existing drivers
Depot	Fix product first time, this was the second return for the same issue. You also introduced a new issue where lid of laptop does not close properly
Agent	Shorten holdTimes
Depot	Just return the menu back to the owner
Depot	update the warranty info from when the user purchases the product.  NOT from when the computer was built
Contact Center	Show more interest to communicate with customers as no body called me and just replied to me by email after long waiting period
Onsite	Change your 3rd party solution provider. Call center technical team should be trained well to handle customers. Their job is to provide comfort and solution and not trouble clients with endless troubleshooting without taking the computer themselves on remote.
Contact Center	The phone number that was identified on my support agreement did not give clear instructions on what to do to reach support on New Year's Day.  Recognizing that it was a holiday, I followed instructions to fill out an online form, but that form was rejected.  I had to do some recalling and research to find the right number to call to obtain assistance.  Should not have been that hard.
CRU	Not to close the call off without the parts been delivered  to its customers
Agent	Teach your tech to not be rude. To not yell, lie, refuse to get a supervisor or hang up on customers
Onsite	Not cancel a part delivery after it was shipped, only to have me reorder everything again through the warranty program. Find other means of getting OEM parts, which is silly because they come from Lenovo, as I found they were widely available through other websites. I was unable to use them however due to the warranty program in place with my company.
Onsite	Improve the vendor quality and technical skil
Depot	don't require power cord when sending in a device- and update your form.  It states that all devices need to be sent with a power cord and then you have a space for you to check it off that it was included - either you need it or you don't.  which is is?
Onsite	Improve your service response times , improve your communications , improve your service information systems as I ws required to detail the service history to one department when another had the details
Contact Center	Stop sending out broken software updates.
Onsite	Be sure the tech receives the right parts. my tech was provided the wrong part despite ordering by part number directly.
Depot	More status update via e-mail
Depot	Fix the computer so that when returned, it will connect to the wireless mouse and keyboard that came with it. I've tried new batteries and reboots, but it doesn't find the mouse or keyboard.
Onsite	do not send part and then a engineer .....faster to send engineer and parts together
Carry In / Walk - In	Must check what customer feedback
Carry In / Walk - In	Be more professional!
Carry In / Walk - In	Mass confusion and lack of knowledge.
Depot	Update their support tracking system. Was not able to find any updates of repair progress.
Onsite	Keep better supply of parts in stock
Contact Center	Shortening the wait time
