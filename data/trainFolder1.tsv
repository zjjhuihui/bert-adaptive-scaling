else	have parts ON HAND for your NEXT BUSINESS DAY SERVICE customers paying extra!being told things are on backorder (and therefore: so much for next business day!) is is very frustrating.make sure your local service contractor will make the appointment as originally set.this is the first time i have ever been called and told another local service provider needs to be found because the first one has not finished the appointment before mine.
else	Reps were great but the wrong part was shipped 3 times...doesnt exist
else	this is the second failure, needing a repair and resulting in loss of data and time, that I have had on this machine, I have not had such reliability problems previously with other makes
else	It just seemed there was confusion as to where my computer part was and who was to contact me initially.  I seemed to have fallen through the cracks and my part was sent back, delaying the overall process.
else	contact me to discuss the worst customer service I've ever received in my professional career
else	Because I'm still waiting
else	the ticket takes a month to complete due to unavailable spare part, it will help if they have stocks of different unit parts for faster replacement
else	Improve personnel on telephone read emails and keep customer updated as much as possible
else	Make the in home repair service process faster and more reliable. I waited more than a month for my computer to be repaired and every time I called to check the status I was given a different answer as to why it wasnt repaired yet. I paid extra to have the in home service and I might as well not paid for that since I spent more time waiting for the part to come to me and be repaired than if I had just sent my computer in.
else	My power cord was not returned rendering my laptop useless. I have yet to receive the new one promised or receive a phone call from a supervisor as was promised during the same chat that this was discussed.
else	Your service is one of  the worst I've ever experienced, from getting switched round to different departments, hang-ups and technicians who don't have a clue what they're talking about, nor do they listen
else	Stop transferring me to different department. Actually fix my laptop when you come to fix it. Do not take three weeks to come fix my laptop. Have basic parts available so that in this age no one has to wait for three weeks.
else	Please improve delivery time period for all required parts from main office to service centers , well services center's executives are good in support.Thanks
else	Motorola doesn't value their customers and are extremely overconfident with their product that they don't value honest feedback. Further, they are unreasonable when it comes to courtesy and do not pay attention to their demographic.
else	"better customer service representatives on the phone who can speak English fluently and clearly. Also more professional standards as the person I spoke to accused me of having a laptop out of warranty even though the previous contact I had with a previous service representative established that my laptop was covered by warranty still. Customer service representative also ended the call with ""ok that is all sorted, I am going on a break now bye bye"" or something very similar in regards to this."
else	Have better resolution for known errors as in the case of the faulty BIOS update that did not even work for the technician and rendered two perfectly working system boards inoperable.
else	Improvement needs in customer satisfaction by providing genuine new parts on service and timely support
else	Time to resolution
else	Fix products when returned with a screen shot showing fault, and customer explaining what was happening
else	took two tries to get a proper replacement part
else	More quality and on time delivery
else	Time frame for initial resolution was not met.  Support staff seemed very unkknowledgable about the current state of my computer as I followed up.  Secondarily the machine was damaged due to incorrect packaging when returned to me.  This means I have to send it back again after it took 3 weeks to fix the first time.
else	Give an accurate indication and updates of when the replacement item will arrive
else	Quicker availability and supply of replacement parts would be nice to see, 6 weeks to get a new screen is excessive
else	Offer advice and guidance relates to the problem I contacted you aboit
else	I do not understand why I received a refurbished phone
else	Better communication, better tech support, quicker ordering process, better tracking for shipments
else	Retailers could update the warranty time automatically to Lenovo as soon as the machine is sold. Took extra days to update the warranty before creating a ticket.
else	Currently waiting on a home technician visit
else	Better parts availability as this impacts on the purchase of the NBD warranty. Better build quality and pricing of products to prevent the need for warranty calls.
else	My initial response would be training
else	part shipping need to improve
else	Less response time. Not understanding the gravity of the issues. It take nearly 1 year to resolve the issue
else	Use better parts with less deffects
else	Better supply chain for faster parts
else	When I first reported the issue, I was advised to ship the product to the repair center at North Carolina. When I realized it may take a week or more, I was given a couple of authorized centers which are approximately an hour away from my location. I tried calling each of them to obtain an appointment and was dissatisfied with no response received. Hence, I called Lenovo again and was offered an in-person service and was surprised such an option existed. Why didn't Lenovo support advised this option in the first place??
else	I requested the correct part and the telephone support person refused my request and sent the wrong part. The on site tech had to call in to reuest the part needed and make a return visit.
else	I am still waiting for a repair to be initiated
else	No further contact by Lenovo
else	Provide more detailed information in updates and send updates via email in addition to posting them online.
else	delays in contacting
else	Tech never came out to service device after 3 reschedules
else	Send better updates regarding the status of repair and become more efficient at repairing items. Lenovo had my laptop at its depot for over a month. Throughout that month I did not receive one update regarding what was wrong with my laptop, why it was taking so long to repair, or even if my laptop could be repaired. It was not until I called Lenovo asking what the hold up was that my laptop was sent back to me. Upon receiving my laptop back nothing changed. From the moment I turned my laptop on, I experienced the flashing black lines and flickering screen I sent my laptop in for. Even after calling Lenovo I was told there was nothing that really could be done unless I was to send it back in to the depot to be fixed again, which is what should have been done the first time around. Lenovo had my laptop for 6 weeks and in that six weeks nothing was done to fix the issue or even communicate to me at all about the status of my laptop and its repair
else	The chat experience was not helpful and was painstakingly long between responses.  When I called in the support person knew exactly how to resolve the issue.
else	Fix it the first time instead of putting me through a month of hassle and sending it in a second time to get fixed right.
else	Shorter waiting time
else	make chat support able to process rmasreduce phone hold time and remove annoying music and ads
else	The policy whereby an on-site technician is allowed to only order one part at a time was a contributor to the slow completion of repairs.
else	More communication and real time update
else	Change the courier company, change the feedback system
else	To shorten the waiting time for the parts.
else	Not make me pay to get the units back to you that are under warranty.
else	shortened the waiting time for the parts
else	It took a very long time to have the tablet returned. Allegedly this was because a part was out of stock. But then when I finally got it back, it said that it was working and no repair was done.
else	Better communication , better parts availability, setting expectation of completion date.
else	make better parts.  Brand new computer had to be fixed within 30 days
else	Ship the proper parts at the proper time.  Get better phone people who understand what I try to tell them.I've had 2 separate issues.  BOTH times the wrong parts were shipped for the tech.  After the first repair the computer immediately suffered a bad hard drive.  It took three tries and several hours before I could get phone techs to agree to solve the problem.  Then when the next tech arrived the recovery USB had not been shipped.When it arrived and I called back in I barely succeeded in sending out another tech.   I had to tell him THREE times that the tech wasn't in the room with me and he needed to send someone.I'm in Colorado, the tech had to come here to fix my computer from Kansas!Both onsite technicians were fine.  The logistics and phone support are very poor for a major company.   Lenovo should be embarrassed. Do NOT penalize the techs for this bad process.  THey did their job.
else	Offer technical support over the weekends
else	Everything is fine, It seems technical chat support is not available for india. it would be better if you provide technical chat support as well.
else	have better managers who liaise properly with the customer and call them back when they say they will.
else	Exteremely poor technician service - possibly due to not getting a part, but also terrible communication.
else	Make updates more accessible, either when contacting a representative (was told repeatedly they made a note and someone would email me back, but never did) or make web updates current
else	Need more communication between customer and Lenovo, Computer was sent but no updates were given, nor was info exchanged, Computer just showed up at my door 9 days later with no explanation.
else	It's been 4 months since I sent my computer in and I still haven't received it
else	Based on symptoms described, issue could have been diagnosed sooner and correct part shipped out.  The first part shipped (hard drive cable) was the wrong part, and was not what was required to resolve the issue - it was the system board causing the issue.
else	Do not return damage items. The laptop was sent in mint condition for repairs it came back with physical damages .
else	Faster acquisition of parts
else	the first call for help was absolutely worthless, didn't listen to me at all, just said try rebooting, etc. I then had to go online to arrange a return cause I couldn't even do a hard reboot. I hate the fact I was forced to update the phone. I was happy with the way it was and unhappy with the new update. The phone exchange went well and was quick so thank you for that. Tech support however needs to get a clue.
else	I never received an email after my initial phone call detailing how to factory reset my phone. Luckily I found instructions online.
else	Ensuring resolutions provided meet the meager customer expectations
else	fix the problem instead of pushing me off the phone
else	Much of the time spent on repairs was waiting for parts to arrive to the repair shop. Having a larger in-house part inventory could decrease repair time. The actual repair was done very quickly! Go you!
else	Respect to Customer queries and provide a on time support
else	Ensure that all local techs call before showing up at place of business (especially for laptop owners, who sometimes are 'high maintenance' in coordinating repair time
else	I emailed, the respond was slow. I called in the respond was fast
else	The very weak link is your scheduling department.
else	Keep customer informed realistically on progress and timing as guaranteed and paid for assistance.  Hire smarter people for technical help.
else	The phone audio should be clearer? had to ask representative to repeat a lot of insructions
else	When the PC was returned, the finger print scanner was not working.  I had to research and reload drivers in order to make it work.  I would have liked you to do that as part of the fix so that I would not have had to research it, especially since it worked immediately when I bought it, without the need to research why it did not work.
else	1) Provide Next Business Day when a NBD Warranty Upgrade is Purchased2) Provide better escalation when NBD deadlines are missed3) When NBD service is not met, provide some form of recompense, particularly when it is missed by such a wide margin
else	Have parts on-hand and not back ordered.
else	I haven't received the tablet back so I can't finish this survey.
else	took to much time for resolution.
else	"Improve spare parts delivery model to offer a truly next day on site REPAIR experience, not ""DAY AFTER WE GET SPARES"""
else	Better telephone numbers and 24/7 on tech support.
else	"1. Make your technical onsite team a bit empathetic. I was told two very important things - (1) If the hardware scan report shows ""No Issues"" then there is no issue even if your company engineer has acknowledged that he is experiencing some kind of issue. (2) i3 8th generation with 4GB RAM,  5.4K RPM HDD and running windows 10 will show a lag issue. For better performance upgrade to 6GB (No assurance though)2. Service engineers who visit dont have adequate knowledge. They call their service heads and follow blind instructions over phone. 3. Screen sharing with onsite team never happens as the tool connection always fails. So we had to use Teamviewer (a freeware)4. Please update ticket with all conversation with customer. Everytime you call contact center, a new guy picks up the call who has no idea about the ticket and customer has to repeat everything from previous instructions. Then he follows all the steps the previous engineers has followed to arrive at same results and then he asks for a timeout to speak to his seniors and the process repeats"
else	Quicker turn around times, better quality control
else	Consistency.. We purchased next business day on-site service and were being told we had to send our device in for depot repair.The Yoga 15 that was part of this request is used as an Executive Presentation Laptop with hinges that are starting to seize up and making the Laptop difficult to open.  We were trying to proactively resolve this issue to request warranty service before someone broke the hinges forcing them open. This process took almost 2 hours on the phone over the course of 3 phone calls and 2 days. Note: the scores for Lenovo Tech support are based on the 1st and 2nd CALL1st CALL  Rep and Supervisor insisted the unit may have physical damage and could only be serviced at the Depot (despite it having an active onsite warranty)2nd CALL  Rep insisted that the unit would need to be sent into for depot inspection; requested a manager and was put on hold for 30 minutes before being hung up on. 3rd CALL  Re-explained the issue and was able to finally schedule on-site service to have the unit inspected and replacement of the hinges pending no physical damage. The on-site representative showed us the bad hinge post repair and it was completely seized up which would have resulted in physical damage if we had not gotten this repair.
else	update latest address for service centre
else	Send technicians on site it is way faster to repair a computer with technician on site
else	I had been facing the display issue within a week of purchase of this mobile through Flipkart.. after that I contacted Flipkart for the return request. They arrived and checked my mobile & made it work after rebooting. Even then after some four days I got the same issue ( display not working) & contacted Flipkart. They asked us to reach out to service centre. We came to your service centre from Goverthanagiri, Avadi which is 25 km away from Annasalai twice to give & get back my mobile. Hearing issue & display issue was resolved when I got my mobile back but from last week again Iam facing the display issue. I am not able to utilise full benefits of this mobile though I paid so much of cost for it. Also we have  a six months old  baby at home & since myself & myhusband both are working it is very very difficult for us to spare time for this issue & run behind it. It would be fine if we get this mobile replaced with new one as the problem sustain from the time we bought. Request your help on this issue.Thank you.
else	make acess quicker -- reduce wait time, if possible
else	It would be an improvement if responses were made regarding your support calls to avoid having to make repeat calls. In my case I received an automatic reply advising that someone would be in touch, but this did not happen, and I had to call / email again to raise the issue.
else	Provide stockist to all Lenovo product sold locally (System, parts and accessories)
else	Reduce number of follow up calls once problem is resolved.
else	Keep parts local
else	Speed of repair could have been faster
else	avoid sending refurbished parts such HDD
else	support / repairs should be much much faster
else	Contract with more professional field technicians
else	The laptop has been returned for repair SIX times for a variety of issues, battery eliminator, keyboard, hard drive, system board, system I/O and USB.  It seems to me that Lenovo needs to omprove the quality of the parts in its products.As for the repair process it has performed each of the times the laptop was returned for repari..
else	need customer care no should be updated in google site to contact easily.
else	still waiting to see how it all works out- computer very new
else	Dont cancel a service request before parts are ordered
else	Not sure if you are referring to my session on the phone with a technician...or the repair that took place after sending the laptop back to you.  My initial contact with someone by phone regarding my laptop was very trying.  First, I had a hard time understanding him and then we spent about an hour trying to correct the problem.  Also, my first call, after waiting on hold for some time, was dropped.  The problem was not solved by the technician and I had to ship it to Kentucky.
else	"allow support cases to be updated by customer service. Your company was going to ship a new part (fingerprint reader, that wasn't the issue in the first place) because of an incorrect phone number on this ticket that had been previously updated with a  recall related issue where a service tech was called and cam a week earlier.  Not to mention the 50 minutes on the phone between customer service and tech support to follow up on this issue and telling them it was a software or a domain network related issue and not hardware ....fingerprint reader disabled when converting this brand new machine back to Windows 10 from Windows 8. Using your recovery  key solution, not to mention my account is registered at Lenovo.com with this computer as ""my products"". Do your systems talk to each other.i was told by the customer service rep that her supervisor said they were too busy to update my phone number for the part that was shipped and picked up by a tech in my area and transferred me to tech who wanted to create a new order and ship a new part.  I put HIM ON HOLD and called the service tech who came to see me about the X! Carbon Recall (NO ISSUE). He said he would call his company and seen who picked up the part and have them contact me at the PHONE NUMBER I UPDATED WITH THE FIRST RECALL TICKET).  I put YOUR GUY off hold and said, don't bother, I got it.  The Tech came the next day, checked to see the fingerprint reader was found in my devices and that the drivers were updated.  He should have shipped you back your part.  When I first called about this issue, I again was on hold for an eternity - I asked for software support and was told they could fix my issue...BUT I didn't have software support on my account only HARDWARE support, so the guy said ALL I CAN DO IS SEND YOU A NEW FINGERPRINT READER. When I said, it was working fine yesterday on Windows 8, but not now on Windows 10.THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE IN RECENT MEMORY AND MAYBE EVER...!!! You spent a lot of unnecessary $ instead of doing the right thing and providing the right support."
else	Problem was not addressed, a totally different part was sent to the tech and then the tech installed it.
else	Please send non third party technician in getting things done. It took 2 months before I got a call from your dispatch/retain team to get back to a dying desktop!
else	I was amazed at the speed that I received my replacement phone. After I had been approved for a replacement.
else	get act together in call center:1) first workorder was incomplete (learned talking to level 2 tech about motherboard CPU was ensured upon repair, he issued a second ticket to correct the first one done in error)2) lots of confusion on the deliverables of the motherboard, i.e. who was getting it, when would it be deliverd to office, etc.3) next day service took 4 days!  :- )4) even though the laptop was purchased in a RAID1 configuration, and the service technician was told it was RAID1, the laptop was not configured for RAID1.  After seeing his red tailights, I noticed two drives C and D and realized the RAID1 was not configured.  I called technician and he said he only replaces the HW and does not configure the laptop.5) upon calling technical support, everyone said they do not support RAID1 on Lenovo systems.6) after explaining to a supervisor who I was told would call an hour later on Friday night, two hours later upon my call was told he left for the day.7) the following week ent through several people conversations only to learn the laptop could not be BIOS hooked to configure RAID in BIOS (because my company apparently block BIOS boot time hook, so could not get to setup.8) the bottom line, as far as I am concerned IBM service center is disorganized, the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing, and the repairs are not fit/form/function for a $4k laptop!  This whole afair cost me days of frustration only to end up with a laptio with two 500GB SSD, not the RAID1 originally purchased.9) the service techinician was okay, though he did not configure the RAID and did not tell me he was not going to do it either, which in my mind was not so good seeing I told him the configuration.10) over all, I am not impressed.  I prefer DELL systems.Cheers,Drew
else	Make sure you have things in stock before you sell them and when you refund something dont wait a month
else	Ensure updates and information provided by me is passed on to the engineer. I had to chase the incident several times and didn't receive a call back when I should have. Very slow to resolve the incident.
else	Improve your technical support helpline number it takes half an hour on line without any answer and attitude of your call operator and assistant who visit to change hard disk and still my issue is not ressolved.
else	Train call centre better so they can advise correctly. When I finally spoke to someone on live chat having not resolved the matter after 6 months they helped me very efficiently.
else	don't transfer people around
else	Comunicate 100 times better and have better manners on the phone
else	Operator was not very polite and demanding on call. He directed me to download for firmware update and I received an error when attempting to download and operator didn't know what the error was. He didn't know how to continue with the error so I stopped the call due to this. I have raised the issue to my company's support and they are in progress for a solution with a Lenovo Representative.
else	Product was returned, Lenovo still has the product
else	Fix up a time in advance to deliver the part.
else	It seems that someone has done crime if he has purchased mobile online. I have not received bill as I have ordered online. I faced trouble in getting all bills from Amazon & my lot of time wasted in that.
else	Through no fault of the on-site technician this problem was not resolved (he is the only reason the feedback is not a 0).  They had the appropriate parts but did not replace them due to the diagnostics working.  I had informed the lenovo phone specialist of this prior to the visit, but they sent the technician anyway.  Now, we are waiting on parts for my system still because of the issues we had - with a broken laptop for over two weeks.  The technician did his best to help me in the interim and with his help, I was able to save some of my computer data so I could do my work at the very least.  I have lost thousands of dollars due to the service Lenovo has provided me.
else	I ordered 2 Moto Z Play phones on Moto.com, Once I received the radios I discovered that they would only support data on Verizon , but not voice. The Website was not clear that this model was not Verizon capable. I now know that I should have ordered Z Play Droid. As a Motorola employee I was very disappointed that when I received the first 2 phones they were loaded with Very old 6.0 Android software. It took 2 hours per radio and 11 system update cycles (~3 gigs of data per phone) to bring them up to the current Android version. When I explained the issue to the repair center they said they would send/exchange them for phones that would work. The next day i received 2 of the exact same phones. I sent back all 4 phones for a refund. It is this type of service that loses Motorola customers forever in the US market. Even if I wanted to repurchase Moto Z Play Droid phones, the holiday sales are over. i would have to pay the regular price. VERY DISSATISFIED!
else	Fix it faster, it took nearly two months for the tablet to return.
else	Plastic body parts are not good. I've seen many laptops are in broken conditions from the body area. Mostly in hing area and fan area.
else	Verify the part before it is sent out.  First part to arrive was the wrong one.
else	Be truthful on the situation of parts and delivery times
else	Through improvement in your resolution speed.
else	The spare part was damaged, the technician made it work but it would be great to have better quality control over the parts prior to a 2h drive for the technician.
else	I didn't receive the the handset yet from the service centre.
else	Repair laptops faster and email status updates.
else	Send multiple parts to reduce the number of trips. Any parts not used can be sent shipped back. This would reduce the costs of repair.
else	could not return in time promised by the staff.
else	Quicker service response and ship the correct parts the first time.   Service technician did excellent job, but first technician received incorrect parts which delayed the service.   The part were shipped to my office from corporate.   Wrong item shipped to my office first time.  Second scheduled visit the parts were correct.   Overall request for service and completion took one month.
else	have a better stock of parts
else	update BIOS and Drivers automatically. My keyboard stopped working all of sudden
else	They kept computer for about month or so, never an update. Very frustrating experience.
else	Not sure on the agreement between Lenovo and JK, the replacement of faulty parts process is very slow (more than 3 weeks) and JK is unable to provide ETA on the delivery of the parts that they have ordered for replacement.
else	Waiting on the phone for service was over 21 minutes. Too long.
else	Customer Support website needs to be more intuitive and technical advisors need to read email responses more carefully.
else	Be on time.
else	The resolution provide was an acceptable resolution. However, it was like  pulling teeth to get to that resolution. The reps only wanted to provide me with one option originally and it was not beneficial for me.
else	Change the phone tree. I wasnt sure which number to hit .
Agent	Shorter hold times. I had to easily wait for 20+ mins before talking to a representative.
else	hopefully continue to provide help by phone
else	"Several Things: First, I received an automatic email stating my case was opened. I did not however receive an update or email saying that my product was on Back-Order. I had to call back into the Lenovo Support line to receive an update stating that it was back-ordered and would take longer than original informed it would. Secondly, when I received the Monitor (Lenovo Tiny In One Monitor (MTM: 10QY), it was a ""Certified Refurbished Product"". This was highly disappointing as I purchase brand new Lenovo Products all the time and the monitor that failed was only 3 months old. I should have received a Brand New Replacement monitor, not a Certified Refurbished. This is poor practice and I was not happy with the results."
else	Send updates of when the client can expect delivery of item s repaired
else	When customer requested for service send some skilled one , In my yoga 920 vibes face unlock was not working ( which mean windows hello) but the service man didt know about windows hello also .. And I had some resolution problems , he told that for every Laptop it will be same it may not be solved
else	Get the replacement parts quicker.  Have better quality parts, and/or better quality control on the laptop system boards.
else	this is the second time that this machine has been returned for the same problem in 9 months. It has not made me confident about its future, especially after the warranty expires.Really a shame as I have purchased a few of these and had no problems with the others.
else	Before update Android my phone battery backup was very good but now the battery backup is poor.
else	I would like the laptops to be repaired faster
else	As discussed previously, faster repair time would be better. In particular, when the repair center staff emails me and I reply to them, I expect faster acknowledgement of and action on my response to them.
else	Several calls and tickets had to be created.  Received different answers every time I tried to get support.  I finally received a replacement battery with no instructions as to how to replace it myself.  I tried unscrewing all the screws on the back but there is one in the middle that won't come out.  I still need support.  I was told the repair depot was being changed so someone would come to the house to do the repair.
else	Initial Lenovo rep sent me the wrong information for returning the laptop. I waited for 10 days and had to call again. 2nd Lenovo rep had to resend all paperwork so that laptop could be mailed. After this frustrating incident, I was unable to locate any information regarding the receiving of my laptop until 10 days after the post office said it arrived.  3rd  call to Lenovo - the rep put in a request to have my laptop researched. After this, my laptop's condition and repair process appeared online. I am happy to report that overall I am pleased to have my laptop repaired and am very grateful to have it back. Thank you.
else	Answer in a timely mnanner and provide updates.
else	Availability of authorized Service centers and professional service and support
else	I was informed that a part was ordered, but never received information on when the tech would be scheduled for onsite service.  I had to call back to find out the tech was scheduled to contact me the following Monday
Agent	Ticket process follow up
else	Ship the part I need
else	New phone got heated up, received poor voice calls. Gave for servicing, the center replaced the antenna. Even now occasionally the phone switches off and restarts on its own.
else	Provide more visibility into the repair process through better communication and improve the use of time by sending the right parts the first time.
else	Improve phone technical support.  Technicians need to be more familiar with the BIOS
else	Send the correct parts the first time and in a timely manner.
else	I have not received any information related to the solution of the problem. I would appreciate to get some info on the issue at least whether the problem was fixed or not.
else	More frequent update on the progress of the issue reported if the case is being escalated.
else	Listen to your techs, when they know what the issue is don't make them replace other cheaper parts first in hopes of resolving the issue. 4th warranty work on the same device model here, and it's a running joke that we have to replace other things first then replace the actual problem part
else	Make sure the computer is as set up as possible upon return - doesn't require configuration in the BIOS or OS.
else	Train online support not to close calls before the parts are ordered
else	Please give your phone support staff additional training regarding warranty and business partner service agreements. The phone staff continues to state that our recently purchased equipment has no warranty, and yet the MTSA website will display the full coverage that was purchased. As a result, I primarily use the MTSA site for all my service submissions.
else	send the parts to my company
else	Provide much accurate diagnostic rather then have me wait for 2 months then realise is a wrong part.
else	waiting for part and tech to come out and replace it
else	Please check the spare parts before sending to customers for replacement.
else	Shorten waiting for spare parts
else	Make sure the replacement part is sent out on the quoted ship date.
else	stop producing  junk ,  stop adding updates that are not fully tested.
else	Have better technical support people
else	Teach some manners and communication skills to your technical expertise sent on site.
else	I have ongoing issues with my Yoga 510 - it has NEVER been 100% functional and after multiple hours (and time lost) spent on restarts, phone calls to technical support, further days and hours spent following processes, battling to get a repair under warranty that only caused further problems and now being sent off for a second repair. I am EXTREMELY disappointed with the service I have received and the technical support staff seem to be working from a script - very sorry Im experiencing issues, a few steps to follow and confident my issue can be resolved. My belief is that the machine I was sold is not fit for purpose and I should be compensated accordingly.
else	Better communication if a part is not in stock and better estimates about when a part will be delivered.
else	I needed to send tablet twice because they did not return my cord or wall outlet.  It seems to be working OK.
else	There are the lack of knowledgeable person there
else	Please reduce your feedback questions.
else	Reduce wait times, increase capacity to make calls at designated times.
else	I trusted your company and bought this laptop and in return I m suffering with machine and  your service provider is not providing any proper solution
else	part was shipped to wrong location and closed
else	It took months to get a replacement phone for my defective phone I received for Christmas. Then I received a used phone to replace my new phone. That just isn't right.
else	Return calls when stipulated music
else	Improve the behavior of the courier service through whom you ship the part. The rating is below '0'
else	Follow through on scheduled service, return calls, and create a compentant customer service department
else	Improve the way to update customet un case of service delay expecially in the case of within warrantee as I have experience thst I hace to call 3 times to ask for the service result when it over the given time period of 7-10 days.  There is no aging report to control Lenovo service response time as my Lenovo just purchase 7 months ago and I have to send my Lenovo for a repair 2 times alresdy.  It keep on finding problem with the machine with difference cases pls check my history repair record if the machine.
else	service center people made me run for three times for the same problem and didn't fix it in first two times but on 3rd attempt, they realized that this problem can not be solved. So, they changed the motherboard of my mobile device.
else	Yesterday,I have received my handset so I can use my handset in two to five days then I can decide Your Service is better or not
else	Make sure that you can send all parts with the engineer instead of the customer having to go to the Service Center when he has paid 8500 Rs for Additional warranty. THe model Yoga 500 has a problem in the hinge.s
else	By providing clear cut resolutions about the issue
else	Have spare parts and enough tech help that next business day doesnt turn into next ten days
else	The part took over 1 week to get so I had no LCD screen during that time.
else	overall service was very poor enough to not buy Lenovo again  have 3 year warrantee(not honets agreement) 1-2 days guaranteed took many times finally 1o days after initial call  chasing to setup appointment with tech rep , the issue was misdiagnosed from the start from motherboard to hard drive didn't have part back ordered trashed all my information including operating system  going on 3 weeks and  laptop still not working hired my own tech service person
else	Shorter wait time and clearer speaking representatives.
else	lack of technical details information support
else	Actually mobile had two problem .. one is touch screen not working properly and another receiver speaker cracker sound.. in service they solved the problem of tochscreem but speaker cracker sound still is there so I have to visit again. I've take one day leave for second tym., Disgusting
else	call resolution on time.
else	I had a shipping box from a previous repair.  The rep could have just emailed me a label instead of shipping another box.  It would have saved a day, but she couldn't email a shipping label.
else	Make sure the service update website is consistently updated
else	3 attempts to replace the part and it still did not work - I am waiting for a machine replacmeent
else	faster pickup and return of the laptop or provide a replacement machine.
else	Issue 1)While doing software update i faced a problem. By mistake i selected 'update both in wifi and data' but at that time i had limited data and i wanted to use my data. Because of i selected update software in data  and wifi mode i was not able to use data. Please give an option in between update also we can choose 'update in wifi only' or 'wifi with data'. So that we can change whenever we want. Currently , once i select in between of software download not able to changeIssue 2. Imp ) I am not able to set my favorite song as my ringtone! Even basic mobile providing this feature to set my song as ringtone not lenovo!!
else	For repeated issue, please issue the new replacement part as this is not a good experience that our laptop has been replaced with 3 faulty Motherboard, 1st replacement motherboard got issue after 2 months replacement, 2nd replacement motherboard was having charging issue by default, 3rd motherboard got RAM slot issue.I am still waiting for the 4th motherboard replacement.
else	not make new problems when you return my product. Better mailing services, it took 2 1/2 - 3 weeks for you to receive it/ start working on my case
else	Better ship times on parts; the tech and everything involving the tech was great, but the wait time for part delivery (upwards of two weeks) leaves something to be desired.
else	There was a delay because the replacement part was sent to the wrong place but it's ok to make a mistake for anyone.
else	To respond to my request for help
else	1. Send all the parts required to address the issue.  2 Send parts to correct location.
else	Resolve the issue and improve the customer service and timescale for turn around time!!!
else	Lenovo can increase it's coordination with it's local service provider to enhance it's service or can employ a third party for helping out with all the logistics and coordination work.
else	Significantly reduce the wait time to talk to a tech
else	The just replace parts and do not diagnose true causes
else	Provide more technical information about the product for those who actually understand and want to know what they are buying(including brands and benchmarks for the hardware of the product).
else	Improve repair follow-up after waiting for parts hold
else	provide NBD resolution or provide an alternative solution
else	Better instructions      step by step when one is setting-up & then transferring info from computer to Lenovo.
else	Improvement needs in customer satisfaction by providing genuine parts on service
else	The ticket updates were vague. It would be nice if there were more details on what was actually done during the repair.
else	It was mentioned by the girl on the phone that I clicked on something to bring this Service Bridge issue on my computer. I wouldn't know what to click on to do this. It happened after I did my first update promted my Lenovo. At least so far it has not happened again and I was told it's not something that will harm my computer so at least that's good news.
else	Installed an updated Intel video driver, not the Nvidia I expected.
else	I feel you have a track record not recognizing design flaws. Our main machines are s260s and they crack on the covers and around the stylus. Would not replace under warranty, even though it happens on all machines Lenovo consider it a user issue. With regard to the speed of repair question, the SP advised it can take Lenovo some time to deal with the matter.
else	I sent the notebook with issues to warranty and received it back with more issues than before.
else	Little improvement required on part availability
else	Be more knowledgeable about the problem, which apparently was caused by faulty Windows update, as I discovered by researching on the internet.  Lenovo rep seemed to indicate that reinstalling windows, which would have basically erased files on my hard drive was only solution....
else	When I called  to schedule an appointment I had to call three times. Each time I was transferred to the wrong department and kept on hold for 30 plus minutes. It was very unorganized and time consuming.
else	Problem was not resolved even the unit sent in to the service depot twice.
else	Make sure you send on time to the day you have mentioned.
else	Improve the time it takes to get a new unit sent. We pay extra money for this specific warranty and feel it should be faster.
else	Better communication and have parts available quicker.
else	still waiting for the unit
else	Damaged beyond use when returned to us
else	Please provide is update.Happy with center's response time nd waiting time
else	The tech ordered the wrong part.  The laptop is still broken.
else	Don't get updates in proper Time.
else	Try to deliver parts in less days.
else	Hmmm, no idea which part can further improve at the moment.
else	Replacement part availability could be improved.
else	Fix the problem right away and maybe deem the product damaged and give me a return.  Allow for college students with problems to rent a computer somehow that works.
else	Service center listening to customer feedback and provide relevant solutions accordingly.
else	No status update from them..We as customer need to go personal to know about the status..No positive response from them. No response to the phone call..
else	Better case status tracking.
else	No further contact - unit not repaired.
else	As a partner, I was appalled by the lack of competency of the technician.
else	Technician went back to nake a report but no new update till now
else	Resolve all issues when device is received.
else	I feel like I got a refurbished computer for the price of a new.  I ordered from Lenovo because I didn't was to risk getting refurbished from Amazon but it would have been the same price and taken only  2 days.  The computer worked for 2 days, then the monitor received no signal.  I had to spend more time on the phone getting the repair set up and was without the computer for about two weeks.  The first problem I had was with ordering.  After I placed my order, it said one of the products was unavailable (after I put in my credit and shipping info) so I chatted with a rep who got the same result and I spent more time on the phone while he tried to figure out what to do.  He eventually got the order placed, but maybe that was a refurbished unit.  Just not a great experience.  This is my third Lenovo desktop and I had an early IBM Thinkpad.
Agent	high service cost for lenovo by your service agent.
else	Provide regular updates and keep to quoted timescales
else	Case was closed with no parts.
else	Service centers are a time consuming and unprofessional experience. For physical service center contact, I would not recommmend. Also, my replaced laptop hard drive is still making noise which is sort of unresolved.
else	Confirm the delivery of the parts will occur before the service is scheduled.  On a Fri, I was told the part was ordered and would be installed on Mon, but it didn't arrive on time.   I would have been satisfied if the service was scheduled for Tue to begin with, but instead I altered my schedule to make sure I was available on Monday for a service call which could not happen.
else	speed of resolution based on kind of issue
else	Problem was not resolved and was also returned with a new problem
else	The laptop was returned without resolving the technical issue (no power)
else	I recived no updates on service status.
else	Please update me on the progress of my product. Adding an approximately end of repair
else	Keep me updated on when it would be shipped back.
else	Don't close a fault without confirming with the person that made the call
else	The written instructions for a non-functioning docking station that was the reason for my call were incorrect.  After the phone guidance was unsuccessful, a visit to a computer technician locally finally was able to resolve the issue.
else	The product has Hard Disk Issue , Getting Unusual (Tick Tick ) sound from HD, Tech visit change HD but again getting the sound, i've return the product to FLIPKART.
else	i had no update from UPS when they were collecting my item
else	check twice what components are installed in PC before sending technician with wrong part to replace
else	Because I have to return my laptop many times. You fix one problem and return with other one or it's not fix at all
else	Provide updates like the laptop was delivered to you, it is being serviced and has been dispatched back to me.
else	The part took 5 days to arrive.
else	Previous one part not delivered and got new TP and this one has mic problem that still exist even they changed motherboard
else	After the update to Android 8.0 the handset failed to provide the usual battery life and charging effecienty and the battery started to get drained faster
else	The contact process for reporting the problem was not as easy as I had hoped and could be made a lot slicker.  Sadly the problem still remains so that needs to be resolved.  Finally, there was no notification of when it was due to be returned so I was not in and had to wait an extra day.
else	supply parts that work
else	Keep track of parts
else	My laptop returned the same issue
else	Try to resolve issue on first attempt and on time services
else	I don't feel like i should pay to have it returned to you.  The issue was reseatting the battery, which is a simple problem that cost me $20 to ship and a couple of weeks without a laptop.
else	Shorter wait times during live chat.
else	Fix, replace, or allow me to return my laptop. It's not even a year old yet. Just let me do this over with a different company.
else	Dear SIR/MADAM,What a disappointing responses, both calls and emails !!!It has been SO GOOD & SATISFYING EXPERIENCES of using this machine until now my first Battery aging issue and require for change. your phone replies of about S$1,000 for Battery replacement cost (almost 30% of the unit cost when bought, ridiculous), and your Standard replies apology without a single satisfying solution with just leave customer alone with the issue ???!!!!... I am really surprises to be treated by a reputable organisation at such..I spent S$3,000 PLUS on this so called Premium Machine X1 Carbon Gen2, I doubt if my MONEY well spent and of my Satisfying Experience & confident of this Lenovo X1 Carbon !!!   Or why should a customer be treated like this?  RegardsA disappointing customer !
else	I had to call the customer care but the engineer was not sent immediately,few process I had to follow according to the instructions given by the technical team,reboot arc,lot of time was wasted in that.
else	Make better products by using better parts - not cheap parts
else	By less questioning and troubleshooting from a technical personal who is registering the case
else	"I am still waiting to receive my replacement.  FedEx seems to have misplaced/rerouted the shipment.  Now not scheduled to receive it until Wednesday, a full 6 days after Motorola shipped it.  It was supposedly shipped FedEx overnight, it will be 6 ""overnights"" before it is delivered.  I sent back a phone that was in pristine condition, always had a screen saver and case on it.  Waiting to see what condition the replacement will be in - suppose to be ""as new"".  Seeing will be believing.  Don't know why Motorola couldn't have repaired my phone rather than send a ""replacement"" pulled from some bin.  Depending on my experience with this ""replacement"" will determine whether I ever buy a Motorola phone again.  I have always bought Motorola phones for all my past cell phones - TBD whether that will continue and whether I will continue to recommend Motorola to my friends."
else	I got an email saying the part was delayed, then a phone call saying they were coming to install it.
else	I was disconnected from the first technician after attempting a couple things to correct the issue and had to call back. I received resolution when I called back and talked to Pao. Pao was great!
else	Make it easier to obtain correct phone number so you don't get transferred several times.
else	Help me return my damaged hard drive!
else	Send Tech dispatch order the moment a part ships.
else	Please align your technician on time schedule.
else	Immediate response is required and delivery of the spare parts takes long time
else	Online status update is not up-to-date. While your online tracking showed the computer was ready for shipping, the package of the computer itself was left outside my house in the rain.
else	because after the technician came to my plance and changed it, the camera still doesn't work
else	From shipping to returning, the entire process should be faster.
else	Timely updates, better communication, better effort for premier customer
else	Only issue was that the wrong part was sent the first time.
else	Provide more updates when computer is being shipped back.  Had a lot of trouble with FedEx actually getting it.
else	Repair the problem before returning the computer.
else	Provide updates especially when there will be delays.
else	part was not ordered twice. additional issues persist. laptop is still at depot waiting on a part.
else	Have phone operators that speak English, and no communication when laptop was received
else	customer care executive taking a long time to troubleshoot the issue and wrong part was ordered n 1st time.
else	Listen to your technical customers.
else	All parts were replaced by webcam still not functioning
else	It took 8 days for the technician to recieve the replacement part. If a service says 24-48 hours, 8 days is harsh to wait for a fix
else	Maybe respond in a quicker time-frame than 17 days, but I was told three weeks, so I'm not surprised or disappointed.
else	my laptop is being recalled for a safety issue and needs inspection.  I need it daily for work and cannot mail it in.
else	I'm STILL waiting for he hard drive to be returned. They said it would be a week, TWO weeks ago...
else	Send parts to the correct place. Be sure the selected techs have time for the job.
else	Unprofessional way of handling issue
else	Hinge issues is solved but at that that while disassembling laptop, a small damage is occurred to base part plastic
else	Keep parts on hand and not let people wait for 3 weeks for service.
else	More updates (by email) of progress
else	I didn't like having to go back to the place I purchased the laptop (Bestbuy), and told that the defective machine had to be returned / mailed back to Lenovo. The trouble of going to Canada Post and the costs (approx $75 CND) were unexpected and I was quite shocked at this as I purchased the item less than a year ago.
else	Your telephone communications need a big over hall, it is so difficult to understand the language of the service person.We need a NZ person do give out the instructions.
else	When a part is sent to the client, make sure that the part is NOT defective.
else	Just notify the technician where the part will be shipped. That's it.
else	better communication and return arrangement (it took Fedex 10 days to pick the laptop up and a lot of exchanges/calls between Lenovo and Fedex before that happened)
else	Provide details of the update on the case update emails.
else	When a senior IT professional already states that a ThinkPad touch panel doesn't work after even after trying in a new Windows 10 pre-boot environment and a new enterprise Windows 10 disk  image, don't assume that it's a software problem and force the user to test the touch panel again with an OEM Lenovo disk image as it does not make a difference from a hardware failure point of view.
else	Provide more information to the end user regarding status updates. Also the Depot needs to be easier to contact.
else	Less hold time, Calls to update on when service will be arriving. better notification that parts have arrived, been picked up etc.
else	I'm on my 4th or 5th visit and every time Lenovo either shipped a wrong part (replacement screen) or a defective part.The service tech, Larry Oram, has been fantastic, but the parts department has blown it multiple times. This last time, my original screen quit working completely so now I am without a laptop for travel. Very frustrating, disappointing, and far below my expectations and experience with Lenovo after buying Lenovo for two decades and dozens of times.
else	make the wait times shorter
else	Wrong parts
else	increase staff and provide quick resolution  to your customer
else	Spare parts delivery process is not optimal. I had to coordinate the courier, support hotline and service technician myself. Very few proactive status updates. When the first delivery attempt failed, all I received was an email that the ticket would closed soon. Ridiculous, right? Also, while the repair has technically lead to the right result (after 3 weeks waiting time), the spare part (replacement fan) is extremely/ unacceptably noisy. I'll soon have to get in touch with the support hotline again. Aaarrrghh.
else	After riding the ticket we have to wait 1 week for engineer visit. If any hardware issues, it will take another 1 week to get the parts. It is highly disappointing.Please send engineers with  spares for the suspected damage parts, we can close the issue in single visit.
else	There was no direct way to reach customer support to get an update on the status, even after checking it online (to ask what the reason for the hold was).
else	It took longer than expected only because the USB he was using did not update for him . not his fault .
else	Service center people are technically not sound and they don't tend to help the customer rather make them confuse by irrelevant things
else	tell me what was wrong with computer upon return
else	Provide better support on delivering parts
else	Schedule return more quickly.
else	Give a better resolution at first point of contact
else	faster repair time, common database between the 2 service centres.  Weekend only till 7 pm at only 1 site - is bad.  It should be till 9 pm on weekends or weekdays for Bugis.  The Macpherson site can solve problems for long as given me new problem each time after repair.
else	Please improve your Hardware troubleshoot  part from your side .
else	Better communication, reduce wait time, more professionalism
else	The product was exchanged with no problems, and after shipping the defective unit I received the replacement in a couple days.
else	The communication on the phone was very difficult I could not understand the person speaking
else	While there are rarely issues with Lenovo laptops, when there are issues, it can sometimes take forever for a repair to be completed
else	Lenovo gave us two weeks to pay for service. I was contacted no less than five times even though we repeatedly told support that we were trying to get the PO ready. We missed the mark by one or two days, and the laptop was returned to us with a faulty battery. Now I have to start the process over. I understand liability concerns, but I don't understand why we were treated this way when it takes time to get a PO ready and our district is a significant purchaser of Lenovo products. Nearly all of our computer equipment is purchased from Lenovo.
else	Make one ticket and keep it updated. I emailed to submit one. chat the next day to find out the status and it had been canceled. They couldnt tell me why it was canceled. The chat agent opened  5 tickets by the end of the chat. I called on monday to get an update of when the tech would arrive and had to figure out which one of the 5 was actually being sent on site. The part shipment had been delayed so i understand that tech's delay.
else	Provide better technical service providers for hardware and software problems for my laptop.
else	"Nearly two months to replace a battery due to unavailable parts - this for a laptop that still has over a year of remaining on-site warranty service. Further held up in parts delays for the bottom plate cover that was damaged, because of what I assume was an incorrect parts match. When it was called in by the 2nd tech to visit, the part that had previously been backordered for an ""unknown ETA' was suddenly available for next-day delivery."
else	Still waiting for call from tech to fix my pc
else	This issue has not been resolved due to back ordered parts. Once completed or updated I will complete a more thourouhg review
else	Better hardware parts
else	It feb 2018 you have not provided oreo update
else	Complete presentation of warranty options & better installation instructions.
else	Brand new laptop not working bought from very and your so called customer care said nothing to do with them
else	no one has contacted me regarding the part.
else	I'm going to give you a call again and hopefully get it fix.
else	don't treat the callers as we have not done our troubleshooting.  The onsite engineer is good.
else	send the correct part and make it not so hard to get someone to understand
else	Advise of the number to call for tech problems directly
else	I found getting help on-line confusing but telephone help was excelent
else	parts replace time should be with in 24 hrs
else	More direct call in access to premier support agent.
else	shorter wait for the technician
else	don't send the parts separately and have them arrive with the technician.   I had one part delivered, when the technican arrived,  I was advised another part was due so he had to return another day.
else	I was not informed about the return delivery to me.
else	retrieve parts sooner. have spare parts in hand. be able to suggest and use the same technicians for the same client.
else	Ensure that the parts are ordered on the first call.
else	was told to contact Microsoft to resolve problem.
else	My laptop stop working after 1 day this is very bad experience with lenovo.you should replace whole laptop wen ur part is defective. Within 1 month of use.
else	Waiting for notebook to be returned from depot.  Please check status for me!!
else	should improve the resolution time. in my case, it took around 1 month to resolve.
else	Make it easier to find the correct phone number to reach your tech department. You should include the correct number in you product information materials.
else	I first submitted an online form, but since I received no feedback within 24 hours I had to make a call to arrange the support. When spare parts finally arrived, I was further postponed for two days because of the bad weather (red warning for snow). This is completely understandable, but it would be nice if I was immediately made aware that no service will be provided during the red warning period. Instead, I had to call in every day and was repeatedly said that a technician will contact me within 24 hours.
else	Better response to problems
else	Make the shipping faster (adds 2 weeks total on the front and back end of the repair). Provide more updates to the customer. I was told my laptop would be turned around in 5 business days after receiving, but it was in the shop for 3-4 weeks. I had to beg for updates several times and had no idea about when to expect the laptop. The computer came back fully repaired, so I am happy with that, but the service interacting with me during the process left much to be desired.
else	I tried to submit online request twice but there was no reply even until now and I had to call Lenovo in this case to get support.
else	Be quicker in returning PC
else	I didn't get my machine back for a MONTH when I had 9x5 2nd day upgraded warranty, and it was sent to a repair depot which is supposed to have parts in stock.  The 3rd party repair center did not update my status or move my repair along until I called 3-4 times to get my laptop to the next step of the process.  Overall I called or contacted customer service at least 10 times for this case.
else	Please improve the engineer quality who have knowledge of the problem
else	Less time in between problem report and resolution.
else	Have parts in stock.
Agent	Better email follow up for purchasing warranty. You said I would have the warranty purchase confirmation by email in a hour. I got nothing. Account should at least acknowledge that the purchase has been made at the user account portal at Lenovo website.
else	Provide faster repairs; this is why customers pay extra for on-site warranty repair. If parts are back-ordered for days and days, it defeats the purpose and feels like a rip-off.
else	Do the service os sytem on time
else	provide shipping to return product under warrenty
else	E-mail case status updates
else	Please improve your service center's attention to customers in regards to follow-ups (progress updates), and service timeframe. My experience with the Lenovo Service Center in Plaza Berjaya was terrible as I had to make double trips there to follow-up on the progress of my device's repairs, BECAUSE the service center blatantly refused to pick up the office phone over the span of 2 weeks. When I arrived at the Lenovo Service Center in Plaza Berjaya to inquire their reason for the lack of updates, the front desk who is also the technician said that the entire office was on annual leave for the duration of the week and that the landline was taken with them during their annual leave days. How could anyone be expected to believe that? Also because the technician said the office was opened during the 2 weeks, then proceeds to lie about the office being away, it simply does not make sense! The repairs for my device also took approximately 4 weeks causing me undue stress as I was promised that it would be repaired by the 10th day, only to have my calls unanswered with NO UPDATES AT ALL! I sincerely hope that Lenovo would please take the necessary action to improve the support services at that particular branch as the staff there seem to be absolutely lacklustre and apathetic.
else	Battery issues (which seems to be at the root of my problem) appears from anecdotal feedback among peers to be a common problem - 12 month warranty on batteries would appear (if common) to be unacceptable.
else	stop sending out old used hard drives and the time to receive the parts was too long
else	Provide greater feedback on when technicians are scheduled to arrive on-site.  Especially when the response time specified in the warranty is Next Business Day.
else	Your field Technician came to our site and informed me that he believed that there was a spill because the keyboard area looked as if someone had wiped a cloth across it.  He took this to indicate a spill without opening the product or testing the equipment, when I pointed out that he had not even looked at the product to actually make a determination he informed me that this was his Judgment call and he wanted to have it sent back to the depot.  Having worked in desktop support for 25 years I was taken aback by his attitude and lack of professional response.  working with the depot to send the laptop back for repairs was quick, and the issue resolved in a timely manner considering the necessity to send in the laptop.  I believe that this issue would have been solved faster if the technician had the parts and tools necessary to fix the laptop on site as was requested when I initially made the call.  I was detailed in stating that the laptop may need a System Board, and or memory as the entire system was not booting
else	"It was difficult to know which day the computer would be collected by fedex as I received an email stating ""the next business day"" and then anther with the fedex label the next day."
else	expedite delivery of part to technician
else	Computer returned to me wiped but problem persists.
else	Holding parts in WA would reduce wait time
else	Some staffs need to be technical enough to conduct failure analysis on the phone
else	No response at all from support.
else	Make sure the additional parts are ordered before leaving.  Tech did not want to open the laptop at request of Lenovo to confirm the motherboard model number
else	Not take 5.5 weeks to return my product
else	Lost about two weeks over confusion in sending me the box for shipping my unit.
else	long waiting time for parts
else	communication and professionalism of the onsite tech was terrible.  I was not contacted until over a week later following the opening of the ticket.
else	Why can't I have an automatic update on the driver if it needed in getting a wifi connection?
else	I am waiting for repair to finish
else	I have been to Service Centre at 6:40 pm  and they were telling me that we are closed now, I was just 10 minutes late and it was still open , the timing there was till 7 o'clock but they were saying that we receive product till 6:30 only, and due to this I have to come again next day very disappointed does that day. They can keep my phone for servicing and can give me in the next day. But they simply denied.
else	Poor communication on initial ticket, part on back order, and during the holiday I was out of the office. suddenly the part is available, I am unavailable and the service ticket is closed
else	Keep parts, like keyboards in stock.
else	When fixing a computer, please ensure that the parts fit with the model that the customer has and that the computer is working as if it had no repairs done to it. My computer had a couple problems after it was returned.
else	When you sell next day onsite cover, supply next day service. Not two days to send the parts, then organize the visit.
else	I could not get the resolution of the mobile problem.  The dual sims are not working.  Only one SIM works at a time, either one can be used.  If I switch on the SIM1, the SIM2 goes off and no signals.  Alternatively, when I switch over to SIM2, the SIM1 goes off and no signals.  Only one SIM is active at a time.  Earlier both the SIMs were working very fine.  Both are 4G compliance.  This is an expensive mobile.  I cannot buy more mobiles only for the fault of company's software.  This problem arose only after updation of s/w sent by Motorola in September 2017.  Since then Only one SIM works at a time.  I have two SIMs one of JIO and another of AIRTEL.  I visited your authorised service centre at District Centre Janakpuri, Delhi and also your franchise at Uttam Nagar Delhi.  Both the centres were unable to resolve the problem.  Both of them advised that Mother Board is fine and no problem there.  then what is my fault?.  Please either send the updated new version of S/w which can activate my both the SIMs or revert it to the last old version which was in force in August 2017 so that my both SIMs start working.  I have been advised that while updating some files of the Operators have gone missing or there was a flow in the S/W (software).I request you to please take remedial action to do away my mobile problem.RegardsPramod Gupta
else	Show up for scheduled appointments on time.I will be telling everyone I know to purchase Dell.  I've always gotten next day support.  And they are there when they say they will be there.I had to make three appointments with the IBM tech and for two of them he never showed.  I had to force him to show up  on the third appointment.  He tried to push me off to a later date.
else	When I called customer support, it was a long process to get to the point where I could leave a number and message to be called back.  And then, several hours later, there was no call back.  There was also no indication of how long it would take for the callback to be done.  In the end I called back and sat out the ~1 hour wait for a representative to answer.
else	Reoccurring issue that cannot be resolved over the phone.
else	Shorter wait times. Explain why the problem occurred, rather than saying sorry this happened.
else	I didn't know that Lenovo would send me a box and shipping label to send my computer in. This lack of clarity ended up with me paying to ship my computer and then receiving the box in the mail two days later. It would be helpful if the email follow up to my customer service chat had all the necessary info, not just what to put on the shipping label. Also the difference between the different service request numbers was very confusing.
else	the technicians needs to be more knowledgeable
else	For me it will be better service and perfect service with valid updates
else	Tablet was returned to Lenovo 3 times and they failed to address issues....
else	Keep your customers more updated on the status of their machine. I had to call the Lenovo service hotline twice to find out the repair status of my machine.
else	The camera on my Moto G4 was not focusing, and after speaking with support staff, a return was authorized.  Camera seems to be working fine now.
else	Keep track of all my support requests and pay attention to what I report.  Resolve issue the first time when I send computer in and not have it for 10 days.  Offer 3rd party support to help resolve my issues locally so I dont have to send computer away.
else	Better replacement part vetting
else	Ensure that the entire product is returned to the customer
else	Replies i got through mail and from service center or engineer were late. I think some amount of improvement is needed in that part. Overall besides this I'm satisfied
else	Still waiting to hear back after sending laptop for repairs
else	Service center team is unprofessional
Agent	I was on hold over 1 hour
else	Deliver new parts
else	Train support staff regarding Lenovo update software.
else	Keep the warranty database update on the web.
else	Improve availability of standard parts
else	Please update contact details i.e. Telephone numbers/ mobile numbers to reach technical support much faster otherwise to just put in a word seeking technical assistance takes lot of time.
else	Improve access to the Ticketing portal - It is difficult to find the portal.Provide updates to the end user - despite requesting updates - these do not seem to be emailed.
else	I never got any feedback on what was found wrong with the phone to justify the $159 charge I received on my credit card.  This amount seems very high relative to the cost of the phone.  This phone unusable in its current state without any outward evidence that something happened to it.
else	Follow up instruction to the customer as soon as possible prior to customer calling to check status
else	the laptop was returned from Depot NOT working
else	Nothing really, I figured out the problem myself before getting the call from Lenovo. Maybe better times for support.
else	Did not notify me when laptop was being ship  & provide tracking number. I had to call & found outit was on its way to me.
else	Free shipping when i had a broken unit within one month...
else	The only difficulty I had was returning it in the container it came it.   I didn't keep the container.
else	The possibility for Lenovo to store some common part in Penang to improve faster turnaround.
else	Ensure you send the correct part the first time, so the technician and myself do not have to book twice!
else	Make parts readily available to bring down wait time.
else	They should load the pc with updated operating software.
else	Send the correct parts to the tech so he doesn't have to come back multiple times
else	have parts in stock
else	Should improve warranty extension updates via website
else	Have a better service partner
else	The notice period of when to expect the engineer visit could have been better than a phone call the same morning he came to site.
else	Speed at which I received my replacement phone
else	improve the lenovo policies and give the solution on spot dont shift the case from one department to other
else	Provide clearer instructions and provide timely updates to the customer.
else	test the computers performance before returning it to me.
else	long waitig on customer care, call disconnects during.didnt connected to technical team
else	The phone I received is already not working and your customer service is horrible.  No one seems to care that I have 7 phones that have NOT worked and an eighth one that is not charging now. This is crazy only had these phone since December 19 2017. Out of 5 phones only 1 has not had any issues. I just want a good working set of phones. Out of 3 months I have had phone a third of the time has been in transit. This is not Sprint's issue it is yours. I want something done to fix this not put a band-aid on it like you have been.
else	wrong part taken
else	Cover shipping charges on warranty returns.
else	resolve issues on time
else	I am waiting for my (VR Headset) to be returned from Lenovo Service
else	Improving the part delivery.
else	Lenovo support was unwilling to correct my issue without charge, while computer is still under warranty!
else	computer case broken on return to me
else	I had to spend four weeks without my laptop, which is essential to my work, while I was sending it off for repairs. On return the laptop worked for three days before relapsing to the same problem. I now face another month without access to the laptop while it is sent off again. This is not what I expected when I invested in a premium machine. Lenovo could improve this experience by any of the following:- Faster turnaround time for repairs- Offering a replacement in the case of a recurring problem- Offering a courtesy machine - Offering a more local repair solution
else	Provide times during the day when the technician can repair the laptop. Long lag between reporting and receiving a reply.
else	Make sure return docs give clear procedure on how to reset password. On attempting to regain full acesss to my PC the 'mouse' would move but NOT action the command. This occurred twice but is currently responding. No idea why this happened.
else	I never received my parts or a visit from Lenovo.
else	keep spare parts
else	Read the case file to avoid repeating the same troubleshooting mistakes. Fix the problem by replacing HW, perform thorough HW testing before send the unit back to the customer. I requested that the shipping to/from the repair depot be expedited but that request was denied. I also asked that a new motherboard be shipped to the repair depot to replace my motherboard in advance so my laptop doesn't sit at the depot waiting for parts but that request has been denied.
else	answer technical phone calls
else	No email was sent when part was shipped, UPS did not deliver package. Case was marked closed yet no attempt to contact via phone or email was made.
else	Initial response could be quicker; a faulty download from Lenovo Vantage caused my Realtek sound to be disabled/disappear.  Once the tech called from Customer Service/Philippines Section, we got things solved.
else	"By not using ""reconditioned"" parts"
else	Back end Technical support team must be more technical to understand the problem statement. Recommend/request to improve their technical capabilities
else	Since I rarely call for support, I was not aware that I needed my SN number. It was not easy to access, so it took some time to reach it.  It might help to mention this on your support page.
else	Send me the replacement part directly
Agent	no one likes to be put on hold, but i realize that's life.....
else	The technician did not return.
else	Pls. Inform to dealers regarding update warranty on time when selling of product
else	It took over a month to return the repaired laptop from Lenovo's depot. Very unsatisfied with amount of time involved to receive the laptop.
else	Shorter times between ticket entry and acknowledgement.
else	faster response from start to finish....better communication in the lead-up to the fix, 3 garbled and confusing e-mails prior to the technicians visit was ridiculous.
else	The first line technical people on the phone need more experience. Also they should speak more clearly and have a higher quality phone. all repair persons should be briefed to update bios with motherboard replacement, if indeed that is your policy. All motherboard replacement should include sufficient thermal past application and cleaning of the fan vents. (The second person who was so excellent did all this!)
else	First the phone  I brought as a gift , after 2 days the person whom I gave this gift returned back to me saying it is not working, given back to the shop where I purchased their behavior was not happy enough, still it is not working properly and I am not using it and I will not will anymore Lenovo, thank you
else	Reach on time
else	Engineer did not updated the S. No. and model No. after replacing the system board. Very poor service.
else	Provide exact time when the technical support staff will visit.
else	Fix all of the issues so I don't have to return the computer again.
else	include lunch with laptop when returned or lcbo gift card (wink wink)
else	Problem with fingerprint NO longer working after windows 10 1803 update
else	I am getting issue in windows update. I don't know how to fix it.
else	After 6 failed attempts by Lenovo support to fix my issue (which was simply to replace the LCD panel on a laptop) I had to contact my Lenovo account representative who took i upon himself to get it fixed.
else	The return time was no where near that promised of one week. I had to wait about a month just to hear back. It would have been nice to see more information on the repair status.
else	make sure that customs who have not got printers you should put return forms in the packaging
else	ship better replacment parts
else	My Lenovo stopped working after a windows update and I find that completely unfair. If I didnt have warranty I would have just bought a new computer and never use Lenovo again. As for the service, the repair time was excellent I received my laptop sooner than I thought, but the process before took days. I kept meeting with new people and they wouldnt believe what I was saying so I had to go through the same process over and over again.
else	Can't fix it on the phone, so I request to get to log a request and bring it to service centre.
else	The telephone service is much better than the chat service.  Maybe, emphasize your telecomminication more.
else	Fix on time
Agent	Problem was not fixed and a follow up would of been helpful.
else	Get the parts sooner
else	attend the service call on time
else	Increase the transparency of service process for increasing knowledge of the customer about his/her product.
else	Job has not been completed, part delivered to me 4 days ago. Waiting to hear from service tech.
else	Tech was supposed to come to my house to fix my unit within 7 days .has not showed up. Service update says issue has been fix and service order closed.
else	You still have the laptop and it's waiting for parts.
else	By responding even quicker , say within 24-48 Hrs , just ot give quotation it shouldn't take that long
else	A slightly quicker response would have been a bit better, since it took about two weeks - and the pickup and drop-off was separate, which was unclear through the email; and I had to call Lenovo back to make sure the faulty device was being picked up.
else	The motherboard I received initially had a USB port that did not function. Basic tests that included testing the board would be good before items like a motherboard are shipped out. The countdown on the days to report or return a defective component should start the day we receive the package, not the day it is shipped as delays may happen during shipment that are not influenced by us. After giving the motherboard back I was able to receive a working one.
else	Better communication, speedier repair by technician, send the right parts.
else	There is lack of technical resources at your service center. If you have sufficient resources, your technician can quickly diagnose my problems. For my experience, it took 3 days.
else	Have your parts available and have a better customer service with you call centre agents
else	dont give your engineer on site faulthy parts again
else	I have been struggling with Lenovo 450 S bought new from dearer, 2 Times it has already gone to Depot for repair but the problem resurfaces, now the key board is not working and unit has always been extremely slow n difficult to work with , my request to replace the unit was overlooked every time it went to depot for repair and process of fixing the unit n return was extremely slow n cumbersome, had to make numerous calls to know the status & request to fix the unit & return. Overall extremely bad experience & I dont plan to buy Lenovo again and moving to another brand for my second laptop.
else	Please be more thorough on troubleshooting before returning the laptop to the customer.  My case is not resolved and I am returning my laptop for the 3rd time with the same issue, hissing noise.
else	Purchasing NBD Service is a waste of money and time if Lenovo doesn't have the parts in stock. I understand that back orders happen. But, that is not the fault of the customer. That is a process of supply and demand that Lenovo needs to manage better.
else	Couldn't help me transfer data from old to new computer.
else	charged 500/- saying that sim signal is not getting recognized because of corrupted software update. Just updated software and handed over to me. Next day i again went there as issue still exits, then they said its SIM issue. They could have done this preliminary check before charging me. Un-necessarily wasted 500 bucks
else	I had sent this in twice for repair..... both times unit came back with more cratches all over it
else	Resolve the technical exercise, from your end.
else	Very few updates. Very poor methods of communication. Service website is basic, uninformative.
else	I was told that I was going to get a replacement , but now its a store credit. The store states that they will send it off to there repairers so I will be without one till they have done whatever they are going to do!!I would like a letter stating that Lenovo will either email them or send me a letter stating that I am to get a replacement model / tablet. When I drop it off, not wait around. I use it for my Business activity daily.This is the 2nd lenovo that I have had troubles with and if it isn't settled soon in my favour , I definietly wont be buying another . I will most likely go back to apple. They seem to have better units and customer relations. Disgruntled.wayne
else	Your customer service is inadequate the supervisors are unprofessional your upper management is probably the only way they're there is because it's the only job they can do. Just total Mayhem ridiculous.
else	Better communication between department on the status of the laptop.
else	Waiting to be contacted
else	Communication and speed up your time, I had to call for an update multiple times
else	Because one time I go to repair the product when I used to find another faulty in my mobile such as volte not showing that's why i go second time.
else	Actually send the part in a timely manner
Agent	Allow your service agents to go off script so we can really figure out what the issue is.
else	Lenovo Soft ware updates Automatically when computer is in operations
else	Better telephone system to get to the right person
else	What caused me to contact you was, during an attempt to update my laptops bios, a warning box opened, telling me the recommended update was only for laptop models that appeared to be different than mine. This was confusing,since the update was recommended by your website for my laptop. The rep didnt explain that this was not a problem. He just installed it for me. He was efficient & polite. He didnt explain that the update would return my function keys to default mode, which I later had to learn how to fix in the bios.
else	I have received 4 compromised devices in trying to get warranty service for my phone. Your repair department in Texas is not checking them prior to shipment!
else	Increase resolution time, if takes longer time to resolve issue at least provide a replacement laptop.
else	Not to have the problem reoccur.
else	Better communications on parts ordered and shipping status.
else	The reason for the weird behaviour of the mobile was not explained and how was it rectified..It was just told that we have updated the software.
else	i had a software issue,they updated the software
else	Better updates of progress
else	Get the parts in. Parts are back ordered.
else	Get parts faster.
else	please update your store locations correctly
else	brought wrong part
else	Make repairs a little faster
else	Provide a shipping label to send item TO you.
else	Regular update on the development..
else	I just wish it was a little faster turn around time or if we were asked about rushed shipping
else	Improve the customer/technical support line, the wait times are horrible and they constantly put you on hold.
else	Able to arrange on next business day on site support unless parts not available.
else	Send the correct part, have support reps actually say something in the chat instead of leaving after 1 minute without even greeting.Isaiah BrowningChatting with Isaiah Browning.12:39 PM:: Isaiah Browning has left the chat ::12:40 PM
else	Send me a confirmation when they receive the laptop. I didn't receive any kind of confirmation until after the laptop had already been shipped back and returned to me.
else	Arrive on time
else	Nobody came for second service request.. The first service request went to great Britain. So no one ever came.
else	staff at customer care center at Jayanagar needs to be trained properly. No professionalism.
else	repair faster
else	more feedback during the process: shipment received, replacement sent, etc.
else	They did not offer a solution, my Tech Team needed to create a solution and we still live in fear of the update that could crash my computer
else	In my opinion, on site service can be more difficult than just sending a machine in to the Depot where they have all the parts available.
else	Since call drop is very frequent in India.. would request the technical support team to immediately call back the customer in case of call drop instead of asking the customer to recall back the technical support team and try to locate the concerned technical person to whom he/she was communicating earlier... Amazon does it.. will be great if Lenovo also does the same..
else	Provide better information regarding parts availability and status.
else	Improve the knowledge of your people
else	get the correct parts and tech to the site next day which is the contract we have. It should have not taken 30 plus days to repair.
else	Ship computers complete with all connectors secured. Be able to ship parts that were missing.
else	Wrong parts were sent originally.
else	This feedback is too lengthy.
else	Have parts in stock when ticket is submitted. It is hard to get next day service if you don't have parts. I believe my company has paid for next day on site service.
else	Response is not good and as informed I didn't got any call from service centre on update. If I tried to call phone number given is not working.
Agent	Less hold time while the support staff was trying to figure out what the problem was.
else	I have submitted a new request for a technician to return, but have not.
else	I had to some extra diagnostics before we got to the resolution. I was perfectly happy with the service.
else	Lenovo sales needs to extend the return policies for their outlet products.
else	As I was unable to solve the problem with over the phone assistance my laptop has been sent to your facility to be serviced there.
else	You knew that the y520 had issues, i as well as a well informed consumer knew the risk. However did not expect a resolution to be over two months. The process takes way to long
else	Every time I request service like this, I get the message that the part needed is out of stock, which delays the process by about a week. However, once the part arrives, the rest of the process is very quick and easy.
else	This visit was only necessary because a previous repair visit had left a critical part out when re-assembling the device. Also, this engineer was given the incorrect part so had to visit again.
else	Provide the telephone number for technical support to new customers who purchased a computer with premium service extended warranty.
else	Couldn't help me or make a sugestion as to how i could transfer my data.
Agent	This is not a complaint for this agent and in particular but for Lenovo support in general. Please align your support team so that they provide consistent information. O have now had 3 calls surrounding the same issue with Lenovo support. The first call directed to me to Best Buy as they were unable to identify the underlying issue. Best Buy thankfully didnt charge me for fixing the problem with my brand new laptop but informed me that typically would. In the second call, the agent brought me through a series of steps and told me to call back to do a factory reset when I had time after work. When calling back to do the factory reset, I followed the exact same steps as I had with agent 2 to be told that I actually cant do a factory reset and that I need to send in my laptop for repair WITH A 9 BUSINESS DAY TURN AROUND TIME. Besides the number of hours Ive spent on the phone, running to Best Buy, and generally unable to use my laptop and taking hours of my workday trying to reinstall drivers and connect to the internet - a 9 day turn around time for a laptop that is less than 2 months old is unacceptable. The third agent was extremely rude when trying to explain why I couldnt do a simple factory reset over the phone. I will now return to Best Buy to try to resolve the issue for the 4th time. If the issue is not resolved I expect that lenevo return the laptop for a full refund to reimburse me for all of the time Ive wasted with this.
else	Please upgrade the standard of your executives, every time your executive call us after office hours of after 8 PM, which is not up to the mark of professionalism.
else	Lenovo can improve the quality of knowledge of the visiting engineer in terms of data recovery and Windows reinstallation
else	I received a replacement device that was not compatible with my cellphone provider. And every time I called to see if I could get a phone that was compatible I was told that I was only allowed to get one phone per warranty, regardless if it was compatible or not. Eventually I got tired of getting the run around and went and bought a new phone from a store.
else	Get a service engineer to contact me to arrange visit!
else	Write the correct phone number and send email of acknowledgement after each phone interaction. We waited 2 weeks for a new device to be serviced
else	When I bought the Lenovo phab 2 from flipkart on 17 March I received damaged charger, as I had given the phone to my mother who lives in a small city I had no option than to wait to get the phone back from my mummy once I meet her. Then I got the phone on 17th June from my mother. As per my bill I have 6months warranty on accessories,so thinking that I went to Cell point in Gurgaon for replacement of adapter they denied   and said they cannot do that. I told them my phone gets heated up while on call and charging. That is due to the fact my mummy was not using the original charger which was causing overheating to the phone. They did not repair my phone. Customer care is also not helping me . How do I use this phone now ? What if the phone gets blast due to overheating? Who will take the responsibility for this?
else	Not much for this particular issue. This was handled expertly and with care. I have no significant complaints about it, aside from having to wait a little longer for the technician to arrive than I figured. Part of that was my own issue, as I did not specifically request a repair technician from the beginning.
else	I was expecting that the damaged SSD would be returned to me to extract the important data from it. If you are charging exorbitantly for return services, just to make sure that the customer does not pay and goes unsatisfied. How can you bring that customer back? I am strong promoter of Lenovo products, but this time i was let down. They were asking INR 15,000.00 for a damaged SSD.
else	Not take 7 weeks to deliver a spare part
else	they can ship out the parts a lot faster.  right now you seem to take days or upto a week.  that's not acceptable.  you used to ship out parts a lot faster, even the next day. what happened to that?
else	The https://www.managedtechnicalsupportaccess.com website is terrible.  Everything else was fine.
else	More direct phone communication; progress updates
else	The part was shipped but never heard from the onsite technician. After a week, called back in and phone support tech said they would contact the onsite manager. I then heard from the tech and arranged for them to come fix the laptop. Don't know where the disconnect was.
else	You can't you wasted so much of my time by not returning a working computer, requiring me to follow up non-stop for updates and escalations. Yet half the calls are not tracked as they use different systems. I stop counted at 10 hours on the phone with your people.
else	I was never notified that my laptop had been received and didn't know it was done until the day it arrived back at my home. I would have appreciated at least knowing that it had arrived for repair.
else	Wish the turn around time could have been faster.
else	not broke any part when replacing something
else	I am still waiting for computer expert to come from holiday in order to hopefully save some data
else	Fix the issue - Still waiting for a call back. The support person threw up there hands and said they were stuped and she would get a more experienced resource to get in touch with me to hopefully fix the problem
else	"I was never called.  The issue was not resolved.  The ticket was closed without addressing the issue at all.  When I inquired about why the ticket was closed, I was told ""You'll have to open a new ticket""."
else	Improve the support web site, make it part of the general web site instead of a separate very old looking web site and at least send an email acknowledgement when you have made a request.
else	faster response to scheduling Laptop fixing
else	Faster customer response time and resolution.Spare parts must be available at the nearest location.Train your engineers to give customer a satisfactory experience.
else	Did return power cord
else	Don't damage the devices sent in for repair; provide tracking information when devices need to be sent in a second time
else	We pay for next day onsite service and are always waiting for parts that are on backorder. Either make a higher quality product, or stock more parts so that things get fixed in the time frame that we pay for.
else	Not use refurbished parts that may have problems of their own. Try to use new parts as much as possible, at least for the latest computer models.
else	faster response
else	Answer the phones quicker. Respond to chat requests quicker.
else	Service Engineers are very bad, they don't know how to remove the base panel those all are juniors & freshers,engineers are damaged the screw parts
else	Put people on the phone that speak ENGLISH!!!
else	They return laptop without resolution. Never used.
else	Literally anything. On-site repair took almost TWO WEEKS to complete. Updates were virtually non-existent and the ones that came directed me to call UK support. Tried doing live chat to get updates twice and waited almost an hour both times and NEVER GOT CONNECTED. The local tech had the part for SIX DAYS before I got a call to schedule. I love my Lenovo but I will NEVER buy another one. I purchased it for one reason: onsite repair. I've certainly learned my lesson. Your customer experience is abysmal. Seriously.
else	it takes unusually long time or website fails even to create a support ticket.
else	Improve comms with status updates & faster turnaround
else	buggy website, technical staff (costumer support) and service centre
else	The operator was very reluctant to arrange for the replacement of the reported faulty part from my thinkpad.  I later learned from the operator that they are being outsourced and every part they replace will incur a cost on them, hence they are more likely to deny replacement until it is not possible before arranging the technician to replace.  Honestly was very disappointed with Lenovo for such a bad service for their thinkpad line.
else	Give better updates and dont say how long it is going to take if you dont know
else	Lenovo took 4 months to return the laptop so a much faster turn around would be nice.
else	still waiting for replacement
else	Please take feedback on the service center itself.
else	Don't like having to negotiate the return costs.
Agent	Please ask the agents to speak slower. I had to ask the young man helping me to do so. I have a hearing impairment and it was difficult to understand him because he spoke quite quickly with an accent. I asked him to speak slower and he did which made it easier to understand him.
else	Quicker follow up after the shipment of the replacement parts.  The internal IT person was surprised that I had not heard from Lenovo a week after the SR was opened and several days after the parts arrived.
else	Give status updates.    I couldn't even find out if the computer was received at the service center.   I also don't know why it took so long.   And I didn't even know when it was coming back.
else	Wait time on the phone before getting help
else	Technician should come to check system in second day after logging call in first day.Issue is not resolved yet.Please send technician urgently.
else	Replace this unit with New Old Stock.  Though the laptop worked fine for 10 days, it has failed again - the problem has not been resolved
else	More info in email updates.
else	Proactively provide updates. Make online chat work.
else	Reduce the parts delivery time
else	Believe the customer when they tell you there are issues and offer a replacement sooner than having to send the unit back 2x.
else	Stop asking for feedback.
else	A bit slow to get to the correct support number, and then a bit awkward when the part was back ordered, and then arrived without advance notification, and then a tech call to inquire into scheduling time to install.
else	Better communication about the error, possible resolutions, and alternatives.  Complete resolution as well.  For example, my machine was purchased with a Microsoft Office license, but that was not reloaded onto the machine before being returned.  This resulted in a further several days of working with Microsoft to return the computer to its former functionality and usability.  This was deeply disastifying.  When a complete solution is purchased and a less than complete repair is done it is very frustrating.
else	"No follow up on an initial email that stated a ""technical specialist will contact you to assist you further"""
else	Improve collection and return times. It is appreciated that it was the Christmas period
else	Awaiting delivery
else	Make status tracking easier to reach  by providing a direct link rather than two numbers.
else	This issue was caused by a failed bios update. A USB tool for users to re-flash good bios would be useful or a bios recovery tool made available could have saved system board replacement and a tech call out. Otherwise we were very happy with the support received.
else	Give a better update on service status.
else	Make clear what the call in of my product means, what it entails, what it will cost to repair. Good communication with te customer is vital.
else	quicker service, I know the part was on back order but it took a week to get in.
else	Speed up delivery of replacement parts
else	I have a Catalan laptop you sent me the link to do the update but it still doesn't work so I now have a product i can not use and can not send back!
else	Faster response time
else	better diagnose of issues and have parts readily available
else	Be on time as per schedule
else	Check the parts carefully before they are sent.  The service request indicated a replacement of the laptop screen.  On the first service call, the replacement screen was defective.  The technician initiated a request for a replacement part, arranged a follow up visit and completed the task efficiently when the replacement arrived.
else	No solution provided to update the laptop display.
else	keep track of the notes and instructions given you the telephone call centre staff
else	Solve the problem in a much more timely manner, and don't completely ignore my updates to the service request.
else	Faster delivery of sparepart
else	better feedback emails were not responded to with the result I had to ring as it was the only I could get information
else	Service staff does not provide logical solutions and refuse to waive off charges for damaged built in battery.
else	Expedite the process, deliver parts quicker, provide engineers in a timely fashion, provide service within the specified timeframes.
else	Had to wait for a part to be replaced
else	part should be sent to proper
else	Better communication and faster time to repair
else	Improve turn around times. Don't make me pay to ship your broken product back to you. Get call center employees that speak intelligible English.
else	Hire more people to take calls, my call bounced back hold three times when attempting to get this recall fixed. I tried the chat window twice and waited over thirty minutes for someone to answer.
else	Have correct part sent to tech to resolve the issue, after multiple attempts issue was not resolved.
else	"You guys need to get on the same page. Multiple times I had a tech deployed to my site when the part hadn't arrived. I also had a part sent to the wrong address and a rep call me to ask if I had received the part. When I pointed out they can look at the tracking and see the part hadn't arrived, they replied, ""that's true."" Great, thank you. After the machine was determined to need replacing, the phone rep told me they couldn't change the ticket, that the tech needed to do that. The tech told me that the reps needed to do that. Apparently none of the different departments communicate with each other. This is just awful. I was sent a box to return the machine in and no one has come to pick it up, apparently I need to have FedEx come get it or bring it to them. I'm extremely disappointed with how poorly this process has been."
else	Repair and keep customer informed - one IM service rep terminated exchange before I'd finished asking for resolution. As IT buyer for an oil company we are now moving back to Dell and HP.
else	Provide timely updates to customers and provide clearer instructions.
Agent	Actually follow up with my request. As I paid and you took my money.
else	I am guessing Mis-diagnosis is an issue when sending people with a limited amount of parts for a repair.
else	getting part sooner
else	Perhaps provide an update of what was going on, I understand that they will contact us after 5-7 days, but mine was at the later end of the spectrum, totaling 7-8 working days. So I thought itll be more useful to at least provide an update halfway when the problem has been diagnosed.
else	Make sure parts have been thoroughly tested when they a refurbished
else	Resolve the issue, update the tracking system so I can see the status. It still says no repair order is in the system and you've had my laptop for a week
else	My computer still does not work properly after returning it for the second time
else	Answer the call faster and send to the correct division  the first time.
else	"For the UPS collection, there was no tracking for when a collection would be made. The Lenovo email said ""within one or two business days"" and gave a tracking code, but there was no way to know exactly which day you'd need to be in for USP."
else	Fix the problem by shipping the correct part to replace the keyboard instead of making an excuse and blaming the customer to get out of the ticket.
else	Keep better track of the process, lots of miscommunication
else	Provide shipping details for parts
else	Ensure the product is returned physically in same condition it was sent. Replaced keyboard was unseated (coming apart).
else	More information about what how it would be handled before I received the email telling me the box had shipped.
else	Manage the delivery of parts better
else	Stop emailing me for updates that aren't necessary. If I lodge a repair request for a machine I have done the toubleshooting steps already and do not want to be asked to re perform these steps. It is a waste of my time and obviously if I am requesting external support I have tried initial toubleshooting
else	Everything. Sent the unit in for battery not charging problem. Never was I told specifically that I may lose my data. Never was I told that the motherboard may need to be replaced. Unit came back to me with a note saying that the motherboard was replaced. To make matter worse, the unit DID NOT EVEN WANT TO BOOT. It turned on but CANNOT FINS BOOT DEVICE.
else	No resolution to my problem
else	I bought this laptop less than 2 months ago. I think it's outrageous to charge $70 for a few minutes of fixing a brand new product.
else	Shorter turn around time my tablet was gone for almost a month, this being the second time, that's was almost two month that I was not able to use my tablet and I think the warranty should have been extended.
else	Please provide on-site support will be great for recommending the brand as per my knowledge
else	There seems to be a problem ordering parts.  I told both technicians that the power supply (the charger) is bad and neither of them showed up with a charger. The first technician was prompt and did replace my mother board which was bad.  He did confirm the charger and the charging port were both bad he would order both parts.  The second technician showed up with the new charging port and a extension cord not a charger..  He said it must be an ordering error.  He replaced the charging port on my laptop which was bad determined by the first technician.  At least that charging port was ordered right.  The second technician took a picture of the charger to assure  me that he would get me the correct charger ordered right away.  That was last Saturday.  I haven't heard a thing not even an email telling me that the charger was ordered or nothing I felt like I was in the dark.  So I finally send the second technician a email last Wednesday and he replied last Thursday saying that IBM services would give me a call.  That has not happened no phone call and I'm still in the dark and it's now Sunday.  So it's been a total of 19 days and my computer still doesn't work and all I need is a charger.  How simple is that but yet I'm still in the dark.  I'm getting extremely frustrated why cant a charger be overnighted to me, no technician has to show up at all for my computer to work.  I have to say what I felt happened is the second technician forgot about me and just to appease me he said IBM services will call me.  I'm still waiting for that call.  All I need is a charger sent to me ASAP for this to be resolved!!
else	We have Lenovo engineer at our location if he will get some spare part at site with him or faster part delivery.
else	maybe send email updates
else	Just better communications about timeframe and parts being sent.
else	Faster resolution, more local solutions, courtesy laptop, supply packaging, etc.
else	- Follow up on serviceI never once received an email or phone call on the status of my order other than when it arrived at the facility and when it left the facility. There was over a week where I heard nothing, then I called and was told it's being worke
else	Lenovo needs to order the correct part
else	We pay for next day service but it took 2 days to get the part here. Get the part here the next day. This is happening more and more and we are not getting what we paid for.
else	Took too long 3 weeks for a battery change. No feedback on progress, no one even answered the calls. Very pathetic service
else	Faster service!Even after escalating the service request, it still took weeks to get the replacement laptopUpdating your service request sytemAfter  replacement laptop had been confirmed, a tech showed up on site with the spare parts to replace the system board in the laptop I wsa going to send back (when the new one arrived)
else	Provide more that one part (motherboard and power supply) for the technician so that he does not have to come back more than once.
else	He called me to take the delivery and when I went there he told me to wait for another dayIt took 10 days for the whole process as he didn't have required parts
else	I got no instructions
else	Service center in Hyderabad is most unprofessional and not sincere to do the job. Whats the point of a center when they cannot detect and resolve the complaint the first time?
else	cut time waiting
else	Communicate the problem and resolution when returning the laptop
else	improve the logistics part of your value chain , it is the worst part of the whole support experience. Each time i have been delayed it because the parts arrived late , not available or did not arrive at all or at the service point, Your repair guys are good and the support reps need a little bit more friendliness. yOur stock  and delivery systems need a  complete revamp
else	My headphone jack is not working, as per your technical staff, 1 of 6 pin is broken and can't be replaced
else	Better informed technicians on updates
else	"When it was returned to me, supposedly with a battery replacement, the left side USB 2 port does not work and the whole computer is running much slower and odd things are happening.  Also the documents in my Lenovo file are no longer available to me.  I keep getting ""File path does not exist"" error messages.  Why would this be?   I think something else happened to my computer and no one at the repair shop picked it up."
else	Improve knowledge of the people who answer calls.  First person I spoke to wanted me to visit outlet when my company has on-site warranty.  When I queried this he said he would find out and call back, but never did, I had to call in again.
else	The engineer failed to attend the appointment despite we waiting in the entire day. I called twice during the day and was assured he would come.
else	Lenovo customer service wait time is ridiculous. I waited a half hour just for a 3 minute fix.
else	Send updates about my laptops daily
else	Multiple visits, multiple replacement parts. It's a mystery. Now speaking with customer relations about a replacement machine.
else	Many problems with the third party that conducted the repairs.  They initially tried to bill me despite my warranty, and the email they sent to inform me of that looked like it was a Phishing scheme.  It did not contain my Lenovo repair number, but rather their own number which I had never seen.  I would not click on the link until I called Lenovo and verified that the email was legitimate.  Upon following up, one of the problems was incorrectly diagnosed, and another was covered under warranty but they were apparently going to bill me several hundred dollars to repair the issue (this was resolved when I called).  Ultimately, all issues were resolved in a satisfactory manner, but I am not at all satisfied with the process it took to get there.
else	Please provide resolution and then close the service request.
else	Wait a few minutes after the replacement part is installed to make sure it works.
else	Have more parts in stock. Build more durable machines.
else	Acknowledge the issue faster and fix not a few days or weeks later. This has recently became an issue, last year the service was good.
else	Better parts, you had too replace my screen 3 times.
else	Confirm the parts that are being sent. In this situation the part was on back order but the part arrived soon after.
else	improve the quality of yourxcontact reps
else	Vibe is not supporting VoLTE and when software updated also it is not working. Returned set very late.
else	Faster ship time, more detailed updates as to what parts are replaced, returning product with all screws tightened
else	Better explain the parts delivery process.
else	Bring all potential parts on initial appointment.
else	Make seating facilitiesSMS updates
else	Nothing, directed me to contact Microsoft.
else	Repair problem, and then keep product to test prior to returning and having same problem occurring.
else	Get a better call center
else	Lenovo, can improve by working on the time that it takes to ship part or availability on parts as most times there is always a part out of stock, and that delays the process even longer.
else	Propose a shorter intervention time : I remained more than 24 hours without a functioning computer which is very long as it is my working tool.
else	Make it easier for a customer to contact you over a problem, the touch pad on my laptop which is not a year old yet, is not working properly.
else	Although there were hiccups in getting the spare part. The Lenovo technician kept me in the loop and showed flexibility where needed.
else	Provide updates on a regular basis for customers - I had to chase up what the latest was on the job and at one point it appears by doing so I actually prompted the job to move onto the next stage.
else	The replacement device received is already started to be bit slow in operations, need to monitor for sometime.
else	Its very difficult to find the Service center contact details
else	Have an option where people who pay premium for on-site and similar service get premium support.  I don't mind paying more, I just want faster and more reliable support and better updates.
else	Give more information and updates on whats happening and improve customer service
Agent	The System was not installed in the first instance and even after two month's of time the same is kpt idle without any kind of support.
else	I called for help and left my number for a call back.  When I got the call there was no one on the line and I waited more than 20 minutes but no one came on the line to help me. It was just a series of Strauss waltzes!  I then hung up and called back and got help.
else	Notify customer that packages are being shipped to their attention - all parts arrived without my being informed.
else	After sale service need improve they're communication between each section, such as I've to declaired every time when contact to lenovo that I had 2 warrantee but they're deny that my information was wrong, and finally at the end of conclusion my nb has 2 years warrantee.Moreover, the hard drive was claimed with noticed that the existing hard drive will be hold untill I back up my all data before return to company but surprising hard drive was return to company without any noticed from after sale team, Once again when contact to after sale as they're will proceed bring my old hard drive back for me found out it has been away out of country already! This is unexceptable all these are happened since I sent my nb to lenovo center on 7 March,2018. Wondering every time I always try call by myself.
else	Still waiting for the initial call back.
else	technical skill should be better.
else	Less wait time on phone.
else	This has been a sore spot since April.  Tech was sent out and part did not work.  Ordered new part that was on back order for over a month.  It came in and did not work.  Tech informs me that this will be escilated and box will be sent to sent unit back...that was almost a week ago, and no response or box.  Not very happy here.  In fact, very frustrated.
else	Test the laptop more thoroughly before returning. The error being given by the machine could be quickly classified as either a software/firmware update required, hard drive failure or motherboard failure. Testing was done on the Hard Drive by request of Lenovo at home, it passed the test. It was also then sent in and I assume the SDD was replaced (as stated on the ticket). The issue could have been replicated by waiting 48 more hours, and turning on the machine 2 times each day to see if it would fail.However, the machine was shipped back to me after the HDD was replaced. When I opened the laptop the first time back, the same error came right up.This is very irritating, first I ordered the laptop and had to wait way longer then originally stated by the order information. Then I had to pay 2 times for shipping costs when the issue should have been resolved the first time. The person this laptop was gifted to is a PHd student who now has not had the laptop for almost the whole semester due to this.. the machine was brand new. I wonder why it wasn't just fully replaced to start with.In conclusion, I am hoping that when the laptop arrives this time it will not have any defects.
else	First and foremost, a customer should never be charged to have a product fixed that was damaged from the manufacture. To me it says the company is not trustworthy, if I have to pay because the company missed a problem in quality control, then my money is better spend with a company that I can trust to fix their errors with out charging me.The people that I spoke with did a good job for the most part, however the phone system was having issues on two separate occasions, both times the customer service rep attempted to place blame on our phone systems, which I can verify where not the issue. As long as Lenovo's warranty service requires a customer to pay for shipping to have a device fixed that was not working due to a Manufacture flaw. I can not recommend your products for personal or business, I will also be recommending that Lenovo be removed from the County's vendor list as tax money should not be wasted having new products fixed due to failures on the manufactures end.
else	Provide UPS return labels instead of FedEx, most businesses have daily UPS, but I had to find a FedEx location to drop the box off.
else	responding with in the time scale stated.acting in the manner to which you are stating in your emails, ie: don't send the courier round with out sending the return postage labels first.  wasting his time and your money having to return the next day'
else	better contact between user and Lenova and not Lenova and government IT department.  I did not know about appointment until they showed up.
else	Your technical support and service need dramatically improving
else	Need to repair too fast
else	No change the quality and speed of having equipment return is second to none.
else	Support team has not concluded correct part. Due this field engineer could not resolve the issue in first visit. This has delayed the resolution.
else	I was told that phone would be available in 25 days and customer support guy had no knowledge and they simply wiped all the data and handed mobile to me saying problem is solved although problem was there only
else	parts delivery and its transportation should be improve.
else	Ensure part availability so repairs don't take 2 months, notify customers if there is a delay instead of requiring me to call multiple times and be transferred between departments
else	fix the issues i called about
else	Replace the laptop that's been broken for most of the time I've had it and been in for repairs FOUR times in nine months. Also extend the warranty since I'll obviously need it on this piece of junk. It has had 3 motherboards and 3 ssds in that time. This has been beyond ridiculous. Worst consumer experience I've ever had.
else	Shouldn't take more than a month to replace one part.
else	First the part delivery took time, the engineers  coming on the site not trained in properly by the Lenovo. The CPU was making noise but engineer went without attending  that issue, gave some reason for the noise issue.
else	There was no update on the service progress. I had to call up for the status after 1 week of wait. They did tell me when I gave it for service that on Monday they will call back and tell me what is the issue and how long it would take to resolve.
else	Wait time for parts. Time between logging issue with laptop and actual repair was unacceptable. It was my fault that the laptop was broken but I paid 550 up front. Would be more tolerable if able to pay invoice after repair or to technition.
else	If ship me repair parts, I hope Lenovo could check the parts first and make sure the part has no problem, then ship it to me. And also, I wish the quality could be better. especially, for P series, please use more rigid material, and high quality screen, I mean, screens with no PWM, and no any dead pixels.
else	Train the technical person and instruct them to solve the problem in time bound manner
else	"It took way too much effort to find how to contact Lenovo with my problem.  We had to click on the ""contact us"" link, and then make a few more clicks after that.  We were unable to find the link at my friend's house the first day we looked.  Thankfully, they did get my old laptop to go online, so I was able to spend more time searching."
else	When I first submitted the request I was given information that the part was unavailable and it would be sometime before I received it. Then the next day I receive notification that the part is in town and an appointment should be scheduled to install it. This inconsistent communication regarding the timing makes it hard to plan for the install. This was on an executive's laptop and they aren't always easy to get such things scheduled with.
else	Detailed info about the resolution
else	tech support persons  should be able to recognize that if the autoplay feature refuses to work even while s/he is doing their remote access of the DVD player that its probably a hardware issue. A customer shouldnt be left with a defective working dvd player on the laptop and then have to call back for help and still the problem is ignored.
else	Please return my computer case I sent in with my laptop
else	Fingerprint scanner has not been working for 11-months, regardless of replacement parts
Agent	Get agents that are better equipped to speak clearly and understand what is being said.
else	Better communication, the web site status was not updated
else	issue solving required spare parts which was initiated by lenovo
else	4 times getting fix.
else	insure ALL parts are complete when sent
else	After windows update, Windows Audio service stopped. We restarted the service but still no sound.
else	You need to inform the customer when to expect a response from Lenovo.
else	my issue still unresolved improve the quality of hardware parts ...
else	Don't make the user create *another* login to manage the repair on a third-party site. Identity federation has existed for over a decade in off-the-shelf configurations and implementations (e.g. SAML)Also, the *quality* of that third part site looked like things I used to see at the dawn of the WWW two decades ago. Slow, clunky, and (to modern standards) ugly and unfriendly.
else	Provide more technically minded staff.
Agent	Improved software to stop Bluetooth failure on this 2 in1After following advise from your agent ..worked once then failed againOther people have same issues ( not fixed) so not willing to waste my time anymoreGreat machine spoilt by this issue
else	"quicker resolution even after the first attempt fails and not have the ticket get ""lost"" and or communications problems."
else	Install all updates/drivers before it is shipped to customer
else	Provide estimated repair times.
else	verify part numbers
else	Repair the laptop before returning. Do not introduce extra problems which were not there. Horrible experience. I am sending the laptop back in to not only fix the existing issue but also the new ones that were introduced by the repair person.
else	You broke my phone with your system update and I'm out $41 dollars. This is the last Motorola I'll buy. After 17 years of loyalty.
else	Proper working and rechecking the parts before building a product
else	I received no reply and no attempts so find a solution.
else	not partic. prompt and clear
else	Still waiting for the engineer to turn up.
else	improve speed of resolution
else	waiting to receive my laptop
else	Technical assessment should improve and fix the problem and dekiver fast
else	Decrease the amount of time necessary for a new part to be available.
else	Fix address labels to ensure the field input for addresses can actually fit the shipping label without getting cut off.
else	returned item for a diffeerant model
else	think about how you are sending the wrong parts to fix a problem when you have to know what the right part is
else	Reset the warranty on my purchase as it has spent 3 months  (two separate service returns)
else	less waiting time
else	I have to wait for a few days before getting a reply. The reply I had was reasonable but not really helpful. I tried to reply asking for further help but I never received back an answer.
else	Streamline phone menu
else	I called the main support and held for a long time only to be told that since my question was a software issue, I must call a separate number
else	Website issues with returns
else	Properly test replacement parts so that you do not send out defective ones.
Agent	Train the agents to avoid guessing. For example the agent guessed that if I factory reset my PC the missing Adobe software would magically appear! haha
else	When you tell me someone will contact me within a day to schedule the install for the next day, that needs to happen. This is my CEO's laptop and we expect quick service as he travels frequently. Also, send your tech with all of the potentially needed parts. Replacing a battery, then waiting two more days for a system board is unacceptable. This caused the machine to be down for more than a business week.
else	Communicate better and keep parts in inventory!
else	More information - it seemed like my service request wasn't updated for three weeks while at your warehouse. There is no email to contact anyone and emails to customer service from previous Lenovo repairs went unanswered. Not very transparent. Also, I am still having the same issues. Very unhappy.
else	you need to work on being more punctual. I open this ticket on 10/30/2018 and it was not resolved until 11/30/2018.It was an easy fix too, it was a system board replacement.
else	quicker service and complete resolution of the problem.
else	Found it difficult to get to speak to someone by phone. Eventually did and support was provided via email but delays in response from both sides made it take a long time.
else	Wating for technical team to reply
else	Make some you do not have to wait as long to talk to someone.
else	be more responsive, make sure competent and knowledgeable people work on situations where service is urgently needed for a lenovo product. Provide updates if a scheduled technician cancels an appointment and we don't find out until WE ask for an update...
else	Actually track the item. I was still trying to ship it and your computers claimed you had it. Allow for something other than just ups...it doesn't pick.up everywhere. And I received the item back the day I received notice it was shipped.
else	Improve shipping time of the empty box to customer for equipment collection as well as provide tracking number for it,
else	The call me back feature does not work i waited and waited and had to call and wait inthe queue to be serviced
else	Lenovo side support is very bad for an issue they transfer multiple agents and keep on telling the same story.Engineers at least visit 3 times to fix this issues and all service engineers are awesome and they did more initiatives.Lenovo side its toooo pathetic.....
else	Laptop returned with same issue
else	You should have to give support on time.
else	Try to resolve early and your service staffs are very unprofessional.
else	Product design failure , which was accepted my Moto and still no resolution to my problem.
else	After mutiple attempts was never contacted back
else	the tablet was faulty so it would have been ideal if it wasn't but the repair process was very efficient
else	I never received the e-mails that the people on the phone had stated would come to my e-mail and yes I checked my junk mail just as I checked my inboxes and it did not exist. I also had trouble understanding every single person on the phone and therefore felt completely uncomfortable trying to communicate what I needed to know. I also did not receive an invoice so I have no idea what they did to my computer. The entire process I was not confident in Lenovo.
else	it was the worst experience, i had to waint almost 2 month for the part to be delivered. Called many times for updates but no one could give me an exact answer. after the part arrived the technician fixed it quickly
else	Expecting the resolution in one service, its been 3 however still facing face exact issue.
else	Making the phone number to repair services more visible
else	Delay in part
else	You could not take three days to order a part. You could ensure that you send the correct part to fix the issue the first time. The only reason that I didnt give a worse review is on account of the service technician who actually made sure my issue was resolved. Bruce was very professional and handled every issue personally will fixing my computer.
else	Repair or replace the unit within 7 days when the unit is under warranty.
else	After being told there was no problem found and then told the unit was damaged by me and would need an estimate before it could be repaired, it was finally returned to me with no problem found. I can assure you there was a problem and I am currently not using that laptop because I have no faith in your service.
else	I didn't receive status updates for my ticket. I had to call
else	It would be better if i received an email saying that the laptop had been received by you, and emails saying what issues have been found and whether i want them to be resolved, instead i rang your company to see if the laptop had been delivered, i was told that the hard drive in the laptop was replaced due to being slow, so all data was lost on the laptop. I'm furious about this as there was nothing wrong with the drive, the pc is as slow as it was before being sent off for repair. You should offer a choice for additional repairs that customers haven't asked for
else	Make sure that updates of software don't cause issues
else	Technician has change the part but mentioned software issue and require me to go to retail shop to work on it as they dont have he OS software. Upon returning to the shop, they try to resolve it but still having the same issue in which they will contact the support to work on this, until today my laptop is still not with me and not yet resolve and this is just within a month of purchase which most of the time is not use yet
else	Still waiting for the OS CD to install .
else	Ensure that BIOS and other updates do not brick the system in the first place.
else	Train parcel delivery company that you use to not leave the returns on customers back patios without leaving a calling card. The Laptop could have easily been stolen from our garden without us knowing that it had even been delivered.
else	We were requested to send in the charger for the laptop but when we received the laptop back, there was no charger inside. We then had to contact Lenovo and wait another few business days to get a replacement.
else	Provide an easier way to contact you, and return all the items I sent
else	Quicker response in terms of status notification in the event of waiting for parts arrival.
else	Return calls and enails.
else	I am still awaiting for the laptop to arrive at my doorstep
else	Please provide fresh parts in case of parts replacement..
else	online scheduling tool, ship parts faster (took 2 days just to create the ticket)
else	Better navigation of website with regards to technical issues. The website is crap.
else	Send the tech the correct parts.
else	It's not clear that I need to call Lenovo when I receive the part in order for the tech to arrive.
else	listen when we call
else	The telephone tree is not all that clear or intuitive.
else	I am waiting on technician to call
else	I tried to leave call back number, but no one called me back
else	Need some improvement for Warranty return services.
else	Unit returned to me not working properly
else	Please keep customer technical support open on weekend atleast on Saturday for ThinkPads.
else	You sent the wrong parts, over and ever in the last 3 months since my problems started with my 3 year-old laptop. To this day, 3 months later, my laptop still doesnt work, and some of the replacements are either not working (the new battery still not charging!!!),and I have more problems with my keys on my keyboard. )
else	Ensure Lenovo computers after a Windows update can still fully function.
else	NO longer supported device, confirmed android version for my region and vendor, unable to update to latest version as stated on website.
else	the issue is not resolved and the technical team is not aware of the issue, and also do not know how to resolve it, and do not know how to check the issue on the phone, and do not have any devices to test it, and this is a common problem coming for all lenevo k6 power smart phone device
else	Not contacted
else	Third return of these units.  Tried putting in a service request but got a message fromLenovo that the broken antenna is out of stock.
else	Provide email updates to customers
else	There needs to be clearer communication from the start of the process so that the on-site techs come with the proper information and parts. Otherwise, multiple visits waste both the technicians' time and my own time. Another thing. Technically this problem is resolved as the webcam is now working properly, but there are two new related problems following the service to the laptop. First, one of the the hinges is now not properly connected to the screen (it sticks out from the back instead of being flush). And second, there appears to be a problem with the screen itself, with the bleed-through or ghosting now in the center of the screen. I'm not sure what the proper technical term is for this, but there is now what looks like white dust when the screen is particularly dark. I don't know if this is due to the removal of the screen to replace the webcam, or the laptop being without a bezel or what. But this is a new problem that will need to be resolved.
else	I feel there should be a better way thats more cinvenient for the client to receive their replacement devices and not have be without service...yes my carrier provided a loaner phone but that required me driving to go and get it(time and gas)...it should be a PPSL sent with replacement device to make itmore convenient...seems the company is more concerned about not getting back a broken device rather than appeasing the customer...i will say i got my device back quicker than i was told.
else	Provide professional one stop support on a brand new purchase.
else	Faster shipping on the return box. We used to get them next day, now it takes 2 business days.
else	Fix the issue so I don't have to return with the same problem for a second time. It takes two half days to drop off and then collect the laptop so time-consuming and expsnive
else	pls make better your products and give services better and on time
else	Better tracking of parts
else	more report on where the computer is, during return, etc.
else	The issue reoccur. User said, F4 Function key not working. Please attend the issue at the earliest.
else	More feedback to the costumers.
else	1 phone shouldnt have broken so quickly, 2 your employees located not in USA, 3 your employees English very poor, 4 too short time given to return old phone, 5 no centralized system to take my old phone info and put on new phone
else	put instructions in replacement object of what to do with the old unit  (not installation instructions).   I got the replacement harddrive and no paperwork.  A phone message said that the harddrive was sent with a return mailing label.  There was not return label.  I went on the webisite and updated my ticket with the question of what I should do with it... return or discard.  No respond on the ticket.  The ticket later got closed.  So I have to assume that I don't have to return the defective drive.
else	Service received was very good but issue is not resolved. This laptop has been problematic from Day 1, please initiate actions to replace the laptop.
else	The technical support team needs to improve their attitude and level of responsibility. How come the technicians never picked up the part and used this as a reason to not perform the repair? It's Marlan who really cared about my case and made sure the technician make an appointment in the end and repair my laptop. The satisfaction rating above is ONLY for Marlan. If I rated the tech support's customer service I would rate 0. One rep even told me that I only have ~10 days to return the machine but actually we have 21 days.
else	Better tracking of parts.
else	The problem still persists and it took three weeks to receive my computer back.
else	Call back when they say they will, and make sure the laptop are returned broken.
else	Track the issues that reoccur and in that case, contact each customer individually. Also for all the customer that hasn't been satisfied with the repair, contact them directly with a tailored solution, don't make them go through your standardized procedure again, it is just disappointing. It is good when it works out well but a specific person has to be assign to an issue which is harder to solve.
else	Send ALL parts the first time...PLEASE
else	Just a little more checking to avoid sending the wrong part out
else	Better customer service, pay for shipping to warranty center for units that are DOA
else	Worst customer support ever received from an mobile company. Despite repeated complaints and having made the support staff aware of the problem in the phone, they declined to help as they said that nothing of the sort I complained existed in my phone. They kept my phone for 3 days and this is what they responded. I have Motorola G5 plus. The issue with the phone is that the phone disconnects from the wifi every 2 mjns. To use the internet, I have to turn off the wifi icon in mobile and turn it on again. This happens every couple of mins. Fed up with your product and you service.
else	No expectations from Lenovo, I have owned 3 Lenovo machines in the past 8 years, all have faced issues and have spent months in the service centre with no resolution. Concluding Lenovo is the same as ever before and will never improve.
else	I am still waiting for it to be repaired.
else	Clean dust off unit before shipping back
else	extra parts were received which we do not know what to do with
else	Maintain better supply of parts- mother board was not in stock
Agent	The only thing is that it was a little difficult to understand the agent at first due to her accent and speaking too fast. But in general she was excellent.
else	improve delivery speed for replacement part
else	fix the problem on the 1st call
else	Shorter service time...my unit was service twice each with almost 24 working days return
else	Provide quotation immediately rather than pending on separate department for issuing quotation
else	Better telephone numbers and tech support on the weekends.   I resolved the problem by unplugging & plugging my computer in.  There was an electric outage the day before and google did some type of update.  Don't know which made my screen go black.  Also, my warranty date was wrong had to get that straightened out.
else	Technician did not arrive on time, nor did he call when he said he would so I was forced to reschedule and take time away from my family.
else	Replace my laptop as it has been going back to the Depot 4 times within 14 to repair
else	I received the laptop back with a new motherboard and now the Ethernet port isn't working
else	Reduce the time taken for part delivery
else	I complained of slow speed and got response that 4gb ram is not enough for windows 10, then why do you sell your laptop which is not optimized to support win10 with slow processor and RAM and if it is supportable for normal home use like browsing, media pay, photos etc then either the technical person giving me wrong information or laptop configuration is not optimised to support, in both the cases i would say it is bad quality, I was so dissapointed with laptop performance, that I had to by HP laptop and want to dump the lenovo which gets the hard drive crash within 3 months of usage. Your technical team wants me to have extra laptop to troubleshoot and re install windows, why would i keep extra laptop as stand by just because cant trust when lenovo will fail, also with hard drive crash, all my personal photos and files were deleted, who compensated for that, really not happy with the product
else	When a laptop is recalled and sent back to the customer after the repair it should not be returned without checking it out. My keyboard was locked and had to be returned. I still dont have it back!
else	1st contact should of checked with more senior tech support person rather than just assume!!! 2nd contact was why better and did what l had suggested the first contact should of done...
else	Answer the telephone quicker
else	Improvement require in services also part availability .
else	Sometimes, the call centre people have very thick accents and are hard to understand.
else	The waiting time is too long, and the status update is slow
else	The initial registration for the warranty call dragged out for a long time. The problem didn't show up for the tech when he came onsite so that makes it difficult
else	Like I mentioned previously, I don't want the person that actually opened case #406RJGY to receive any bad marks for this.  The person that opened case #406PWYL was a nightmare, and each person that I spoke to afterwards about the issue was clueless, until I finally reached the person that started case#406RJGY.  Just a brief history, I was responsible for bringing Lenovo in house.  I'm the IT Client Services Manager at our company and after many years with Dell, we switched to Lenovo about 5 years ago.  It was a battle trying to change 'our culture', but I convinced them that Lenovo was the best way to go for our future needs.  This type of experience makes myself look very bad and that's why I'm so frustrated about this recent experience.  If top quality service isn't a priority, then I have 1,000+ users looking at me.  The person that opened the original case put me through a lot of anguish and it's not appreciated.  I still have no idea how fixing a broken LCD, something that unfortunately happens more often than it should, has some type of part that was on backorder for weeks, and supposedly still is.  Fortunately, the person that I last spoke with saved the day for me and helped me get the laptop out to depot for a quick turnaround.  I'm happy the issue is resolved now, but extremely irritated that I was put through the horrible customer service experience.
else	The reason for my dissatisfaction was that niether Motorola or TMobile wanted to accept responsibility for my defective device ,so I was basically fighting with both companies for over a week , all this while I didn't have the services of my phone  , I did eventually receive a replacement phone from Motorola , but the aggravation I went through and the countless hours spent on the phone ,has left a very bad taste in my mouth , I was a long time customer of Motorola product , but moving forward I don't think I would purchase another phone from Motorola .
else	I have request for repair for 4 times and still having issues. The most ridiculous thing is that the support keep close my ticket without contact us. When I call in to follow up and complain, the rep told me I have to send back the unit to repair center without any ETA.
else	Call before coming and also ship parts to techs so they dont waste customers time!
else	reduce wait time
else	The replacement phone I have received is still not active through my carrier because they said it is a black listed or stolen phone.  I haven't heard anything from the phone I sent in and all the info is in it yet.
else	If a  issue occurs and a product  requires  significant  repair/spare part  so soon  after purchase, it is not fit for purpose , so Lenovo should  offer a free of charge repair as a gesture of good will.
else	Issue tried to resolve on phone, but still the issue is not resolved. Asked me to format PC and reinstall OS and I did the same which took me around 2 days of effort but still I am facing the same issue I.e., slow booting issue. # Never Lenovo again. Thanks.
Agent	The agent did not speak clearly - accent / language made it difficult
else	The part could be available sooner than 4 weeks from calling
else	The timing isn't always exactly next business day, especially if part isn't available. Improve callback times.
else	"Return voicemails left on your phone line that you publish in the documentation returned with the device. (877-273-7835 option 2). First, turnaround was EXCELLENT on the device repair. Unfortunately, device returned without hard drive screw (understandable). Called number and left messages multiple times with detailed information that I needed screw shipped. No return call. Device unusable without hard drive mount screw. Called again but chose Option 1 and actually got a human being who shipped a screw promptly. What would have been an awesome service experience (a ""10"") turned out to be a ""5"" due to nobody responding to voicemail on the published repair center line."
else	It took more than 2 months to process the service request with multiple phone calls, emails and remote session investigations and 3 visits by the technician and sadly its not 100% resolved.In first attempt, after breif investigation, the existing touchchpad with fingerprint reader was replaced with touchpad without fingerprint reader and to make thing worse that did not fix the issue. On complaint, the service agent cited warranty limitations that the machine doens't come with fingerprint reader and seem to have been upgraded and the warranty doesn't cover the upgraded part with fingerprint reader. I bought it on Amazon.com in US from a dealer (not from Lenovo store) and it came with warranty. Now, how the hell will I know if the laptop was upgraded or not and i tried to convince the same but the support staff won and I gave up as she promised that the touch pad issue will be fixed. Next time she came back and asking me to do a remote session to investigate the issue and spent about 30 minutes, but that was not enough as after a couple of days there was another 30 minutes session with the technical support engineer this time who repeated the same stuff wasting both of our times. Finally, he suggested replacement of the touchpad. The service engineer visited again (2nd visit) to replace the part, this time to my surprise the part had fingerprint reader however the happiness was short lived as the part was a used and defective, the tap button below the touch pad were not working. I had to live with it until he came back the 3rd time to replace it again. Now, I have given it up as I don't have any more time and energy to deal with you guys.
else	Faster sparepart delivery.
else	Clearer instructions on website as to warranty process.  It was easy to find the warranty status, but hard to figure out how to make a claim, and there was no description of what to expect after submission.
else	Because the volte video calling feature is not yet updated and it covers half of the screen by the calling functions.
else	The phone support was lacking, but the guy that came out more than made up for the poor phone service.
else	Give field techs better access to parts needed
else	be more available by phone or email. actually help me by sending the box to the right address.
else	Try to resolve issue, dont just keep product and return without doing anything.
else	Do not close ticket when the issue is not fully resolved and user asked not to do so by update on the ticket!
else	I don't see how you could improve on the service I received
else	1) Ship the right part the first time2) Don't confuse my ticket with another persons
else	Documentation needs to be proper at the time of part delivery.
else	Simplify the method of downloading driver updates.
else	dont care attitude of the service professional. They couldnt fix the problem in phone. On top of that didnt fix the screws of motherboard properly. Original device had 13 screws to bolt the motherboard, they gave the device back to me with hardly 5 screws, when I insisted they put 2-3 more and gave back, again when I pointed out they put two more screws and gave back again and this kept repeating. Finally when I reached home i saw the most crucial screw that holds battery connector in place is still missing. Overall I felt the service engineers are least bothered about providing service. In my case the battery door was originally cracked so I saw the screws, I am not sure what they do for others who get back sealed phones after service. Pathetic.
else	Service time was delayed by lack of parts. Provide the servicing tech with all of the necessary parts to fix the issue.
else	Have the people who speak to you know what they are talking about...I had to speak top a supervisor or someone in charge to voice my concern.  They were also suppose to direct the return of my hard drive...called back and they were to get back with me...still waiting..... not response as of yet.  Very dissatisfied!
else	Improve availability of replacement parts
else	Because it was a brand new laptop with a hardware defect, it would have been nice to get a replacement shipped and return the original rather than scheduling an appointment for a technician, which turned out to take just about as long.
else	provide laptops which are fast in processing and service should be done selflessly, help in software updates.
else	An seer the phone faster
else	It took a long time to send and receive the broken computer via UPS cargo. UPS cargo does not regularly deliver to our university (only once a week or so).  Other cargo carries (Yurtii, Aras) on the other hand, deliver packages every day.
else	Still waiting
else	Try to give me update on the system as the system interface still unstable to be used in the moment.
else	Free phone service clearly marketing website
else	Dont advertise a two week return period and then take two months. Dont tell me it will be done next week every single week for a month.
else	More improved communication - SMS updates
else	waiting for a part to be available monitor / thinks this should be on stock
else	Respond faster as I often have to wait more than a week plus to get any resolution.
else	So far I have phoned on 4 occasions to no avail. The Active Pen product I bought for my daughter for xmas although listed as being compatible with a Lenovo Yoga laptop turns out according to your technical department not to be compatible. I therefore asked for a refund, I was given a ticket number (1061005)  and told I would be contacted within 48 hours to have the device picked up and a refunded but so far despite 3 subsequent phone calls over a 3 week period this has not happened and I guess I am going to have to ring again today to see if I can take this matter further and make an official complaint.
else	Faulty replacement part.
else	Make the emailed website links to status updates go direct to the case in question.  Currently they open a standard form and every time when I put in the required information it could NOT find my case number/case/update/etc.
else	being faster to respond and also improve time without the product while tis being shipped / replaced
else	1. Be more careful when repairing on site to avoid second visits.2. Shorten timeframe for repairs.3. Employ more people for the customer service (telephone)
else	The people from the service center are not professional. The reason why I am saying this, for   1 hours of work, I waited there for 3 and half hour.
else	My issues reoccured once I hung up the phone. Gave up and didn't call back.
else	Don't use Third Party for technical support.
else	Verify parts are working before sending tem out to the tech to install.
else	Status updates could be better.
else	totally test the device before returning it. that means everything
else	Give your service center reps a better atmosphere to work in and give them tools to help customers know where things are at during the resolution process so we don't have to call back over and over.
else	The phone I received work as it should had no issues with it at all. The whole process was easy and the representative I worked with was great
else	"Keep better updates with the customer - I sent my tablet in back in November and didn't hear anything about it or where i was or if I was getting it back until it was shipped in December. There was no way to also change the shipping address as I needed it sent somewhere else. Customers spend a lot of money on their products and would appreciate notifications like; ""We received your package!"", ""It is being fixed."" ""We are almost done!"", ""We're all set, where do you want it shipped to?"""
else	maybe make the contact numbers more obvious
else	They have share there knowledge with me for better improvemet. To know about what is boot manager and why it is failed
else	instead of wasting time on technical support, technicians could have been sent just like other home appliances.
else	If the part is replaceable without a Tech, for example, a display. if the person just needs the part, send the part. I would think that it would be less cost involved if that is done. Especially when the person calling in for the part is capable of replacing it.
else	expedite delivery part and replacement.
else	Very worst service gave my Moto charger and they returned me a Lenovo charger. It's a very low quality and it's heating my phone and charger.
else	Repair was delayed by incorrect part being sent the first time. On site tech realized the received part was wrong replaced the order and then rescheduled after the part arrived for the second time.
else	Have better QC on your replacement parts.
else	waiting for a box to return this unit for service.
else	Give actual dates for parts
else	make the equipment big enough to accept the updates for windows 10
else	While the swap out of my hard drive went smoothly, my laptop has been unable to fully update the windows OS since. I am considering contacting service again if the issue persists. The new OS you sent via flash drive no longer has the app that found the issue in the first place.  I keep getting error messages every time the laptop tries to update, even though it is always connected to the internet.
else	It would be better to just click on the link for updates and not have to fill in blanks with info.
else	Do repairs quicker, provide accurate information online, couldnt log into system several times, send computer back and not have it locked,
else	Issue not supported, not covered by warranty or referred to a third party
else	still waiting for laptop to be returned
else	Check my feedback points on page 1.
else	Resolve issue between touch screen & windows update
else	I received a new phone back and not a refurbished phone, in less than 3 days.This phone works much better than the phone that I purchased, now I realize that I really had a defective phone from the beginning. I thank you all at Motorola so much. A happy customer is a great customer and that I am.
else	More thorough testing of the device before returning
Agent	Customer care executive was not aware of the technicality of issue and often had to put me on hold to ask someone else in his/her team. Also couldn't explain well in English either.
else	Laptop has faced several major issues and I had to continually seek help to replace parts.
else	"Watch the quality of the parts, the engineer was given a faulty ""reconditioned"" screen as a part which then blew my motherboard.  So I had to wait for another screen and a motherboard."
else	Send more parts other than what support agent thinks are needed.
else	Reduce turnaround time, more updates.
else	Better updates throughout the process
else	Make sure replacement parts work before sending them....
else	Timely responses to support requests.E-mail confirmation of expected next steps in diagnosis/resolution.Actually fixing the problem.
else	To make service centres in UK so the repair could be faster
else	Improve your technical support hotline.Once technical support receive job to call customer to give an estimated time. Call customer if there is a delay in arriving customer place.
else	2 minutes after receiving confirmation of call being logged, the call was closed.  Unable to get in touch with support.
else	The technician that arrived did not know how to fix the issue my laptop was having with the hinge and panel. He removed my back panel as a part of replacing the hinge. The back panel was in excellent condition. The replacement was not. In the end, he told me to use scotch tape to hold my LCD panel on. I requested that instead of having him come back the next day, I just wanted depot service to send it in to someone that has actually worked on this type of laptop before. And to top it all off, the technician was ill, was wiping his snot on his pants, while working on my system. The technician was very friendly and nice, but I needed to let you know that this was not a successful visit. I'm hoping the depot service for my laptop works out well.
else	Fix the shipping label issue that has happened multiple times with me. I also was supposed to be refunded for the shipping label I ended up having to buy. I never was reimbursed. The process took very long and it was only completed once I complained multiple times.
else	very bad just new and its not working , screen, software, motherboard issue customer send the tab for repair 3 times with different issues
else	Timely feedback would increase customer satisfaction
else	Wrong part supplied ( twice )
else	Cannot think of anything particular.
else	My issue has not even been resolved and you are asking for feedback regarding my experience. I do not think Lenovo can change my opinion. Utter failure
else	Providing timeline for part delivery.  I never expected it to take a week for a part to be delivered.
else	If you need technician to take video for the replacement part, please provide clear instruction.
else	Cut the waiting time
else	Use standard grade parts on manufacturing Time.
else	Don't forget to return the power supply I shipped to you
else	have a system in place where the person who takes the tech calls spell the mailing street address correct. The person misspell my street address for the returning box. My neighbor give it to me. Even when I call Lenovo back to have it corrected with the correct spelling the shipping box still was incorrect and the 2nd person I talked to said the spelling doesn't matter just the zip code.
else	Not take so long and keep me updated with the progress.
else	[1] Improve contact centre courtesy [2] get the right parts to the right place at the right time [3] do what you say in meeting the dates that you give to customers
else	not much but would like to suggest that don't put Lenovo on the return address as they tried to open the my box. there's a slit about 3 inches which pretty much opens the box.
else	Please make sure the appropriate part are ordered when making a request
else	I see more technical problems with the Lenovo Brand than I did with other brands.  More HDD Failures, and systems problems.
else	Resolve the issues with in 3 days, maintain spare parts for immediate service to your clients on critical situation.
else	The problem reoccurred within days after receiving the laptop.
else	More frequent updates on progress
else	Lenovo improve my experience through their services even though the response was late but at the end the status of machine repair was Good and sometimes you will be satisfied.
else	The field technician assigned my ticket realized that Lenovo had ordered the wrong part before it had arrived.  He found the right part and made sure it was shipped to me.  Great service and attention to detail!  Thanks Greg!
else	guide us on regular basis about new security updates and firmware updates and all other necessary information about Lenovo laptops
else	cut tine waiting
else	It all depends on who picks up the phone! The first representative was awful. I could barely understand her and she could barely understand me. I didn't feel like I could trust her. So I called back and another person picked up. I could tell as soon as he spoke that he was much more confident. He helped me out immediately and I really appreciated that he went above and beyond!! I hope you have his name (cause I can't remember) associated with this cause, but he was very helpful!
else	Provide more accurate updates on-line so customer does not have to call in to get updates.  On-line updates are not keep up to date and are not accurate to the step the repair is in.
else	Answer my question still waiting
else	Need to improve product as I have sent in for repair (hardware as well as software) several times.
else	First of all it is first time in my life a buy a new electronic product and it proves faulty after one month of use [see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBptAzcDadw]The experience for the collection of the product from my address was also surprising, they asked me to find a box to pack the product and more ironically they returned the product in the same given box !!! I don't know if this is related to the local courier partner in Athens, Greece but as a customer of Lenovo I found the experience disturbing. In addition I am not confident there is no further damage to my product just because of the unsafe transport conditions.
else	I think it would be to take as little time as possible, only focus on the desired problem, and know the updated version of Lenovo settings.
else	Answer the phone,over a week to get through
else	Better online tracking of progress. I had the computer fixed and back to me before it was listed as having been received by Lenovo.
else	Better communication of who the tech (or at least the tech company) is that is assigned to the case, and implementation of a method of more reliably providing feedback regarding On-site Technicians on a case by case basis.
else	Sound clarity on the phone could be better.
else	There is an expectation when you buy a brand new computer that it is going to work.  As soon as it installed updates the keyboard stopped working.  This is completely unacceptable.  If I could have, I would have returned the product and asked for my money back but it was a Christmas present.
else	You haven't returned my PC
else	There was evidently a delay in getting the parts needed to replace a motherboard on the T470 however it took from 7/19/2018 to 8/8/2018 to finally get a technician on-site I had to keep calling Atlanta GA to inquire about the status of this incident
else	Better  status update capabilities
else	when a customer log a call regarding a faulty issue, and further more if its a OBF (Open Box Faulty Unit), please follow up and provide the updates before the customer do a own follow up on the report.
else	I have a crack on the cover of the screen part of laptop . I mentioned about it in the letter that we have to send . But it was not recognised .
else	i send my computer 2 times to lenovo, and the comouter not repair.
else	"The initial reported problem has been classed as a chargeable replacement but I still haven't received a quote by email.  I phoned again today as I still hadn't received the quote.  Turns out the quote was sent to my email address incorrectly despite me emailing ""frontoffice@uk.ibm.com"" with the initial problem.For info my email address is alan.mclean@eur.cushwake.com and I would like to receive the quote at your earliest opportunity."

else	My opinion is not based on my recent tech support call, but my experiences with Lenovo since I bought your product.
else	If diagnosed that no hardware was defective then not return it back right away?
else	No one has contacted me
else	better communication when chatting or calling support
else	While replacing part better to replace orginal part not republished one.
else	The tracking function wasn't working. The repair turned around quickly though, so there was little wait.
else	The Chromebook was returned but the problems are still present.
else	hard to reach the technical person, too many details taken and verified twice thrice, call drops and time taking
else	shorter wait time on phone responce

else	Shorten the hold time on the phone.
else	still waiting for X1 tablet and not update was provided
else	problem was not resolved for 2 months - then returned broken/no longer charges.
else	The monitor was faulty when received but I have to wait for a replacement after the damaged one was returned. I had to chase to arrange the collection as I was not contacted within the advised timeframe.
else	1.  You can not refuse to accept a defective product for return when the claim was made under warranty.  2.  Offer recalls for a known issue on a $1,200 laptop.  3.  Have an actual customer service telephone number.  Not tech support, not sales, but customer support.  I'm putting it all over twitter and facebook and online comments that this product doesn't work and Lenovo refuses to fix it.
else	Stop cutting people off the phoneline
else	i received initial email stating that part was ordered but no follow up email with status. Took over 14 days to receive. For that long period of time i think a status update would have been helpful especially with business computers.
else	Phone lines were closed at weekends, and also phone lines close at 6pm. And the chat system online is also closed when phone lines are shut so no issue can be resolved outside of working hours
else	i want to return computer for full refund
else	The laptop was damaged whilst with Lenovo and returned with missing parts. This is simply not good enough.
else	part deliver asap at partner end
else	Deliver the replacement parts, battery in this case, so affected computer can be run without power cord.
else	Answer the phone quicker and be more specific on repair times
else	horrible services, no tracking in place, misinform customer about status, no proactive communication, worst computer i have ever had
else	Better notification when parts received are wrong

else	test parts before shipping them to a tech
else	The parts have not been installed
else	Be more clear that the tech is picking up the part shipped to me
else	I am still waiting to receive a cable for y power supply. It was never returned.
else	Lenovo technician came but did not see an issue.
else	Send the parts faster to fix customer computers
else	Reduce the time taken to take the technical team. Each phonecall was taking one and a half hour
else	The mobile was returned without replacing the faulty hardware and your  Service team confirmed that Mother board doesn't come under Warranty.
else	faster turnaround and easier to find link to request repair.
else	By reducing the waiting time to speak to a customer support
else	waiting time was too long to get to a technician
else	Lenovo sent the technician the wrong replacement part, for the second time.
else	Reduce the wait time.  30 minutes is tooooo much.
else	The part was not available on the day that I expected, but it was the next day. So, having the system board always available would be an improvement.
else	Repair or replace the unit faster
else	Quicker on-line support response time
else	I purchased a Lenovo and purchased premium service. That is what I expected, not what I received.
else	Keep reparing the product still not working after 4 times repair done.
else	Approached Lenovo about an error code, Oxc0000001; the error message further suggested that I contact Lenovo to access installation media. After an hour long attempt by the Lenovo tech at resolving the issue, the problem has gotten worse; contacted Lenovo again only to learn that I may have to get help from outside techs. You can figure out what would have helped.
else	Put the proper premium service call in number on the initial correspondence. We were bounced around before we got to the service we needed.
else	No agent ever called me back
else	Laptop was missing ac power cord when returned from depot.  Had to call to get replacement sent, which took an additional week ti receive.  Unable to use laptop until it arrived.
else	The part was unavailable at the time I called and the onsite technician, no fault of his own was under staffed so had to delay his arrival for one day.
else	Better management of parts inventory.
else	relaced parts are defective... it should be checked before sending to the customer.
else	Better support partners
else	Make things simpler, had to waiting for different emails from different departments to make payments. whole time to complete service was doubled by these delays
else	A little more communication with customer when a product is returned for service.   I sent 2 products in for service and 1 was returned repaired but the second one is a mystery.  I'm not sure if they are repairing it, if it's done or if they can't seem to find a problem with it.
else	give updates. deliver on times. have your website working. have the number available. it was a needle in haystack just to find the warranty phone number
else	1) Your tracking system is very confusing.  We had multiple service order numbers and service request numbers.  We received no on-going notifications of the repair status (received, in process, shipped, etc.). 2) To say your shipping department is bad would be an understatement.  We packaged the computer in its original box including the original form packaging to send it to you.  It came back in a box twice the size of the computer with a few foam blocks.  The computer case was broken from the machine bouncing around within the box.  It would be been comical if it wasn't our computer. 3) Your customer service department is not willing to take responsibility for its own mistakes.  They actually suggested we pay to ship the computer back again after it was broken by your lack of any concern around how it was shipped to us.
else	Refer to earlier feedback
else	These trackstick buttons of my laptop was not working properly. There was some issue which was told as software error. After reinstallation of Windows as well, the error persisted. which was later identified as Hardware error & the Touchpad including trackstick button was replaced...
else	Provide better and more accessible telephone support
else	include instruction on customer replaceable items
else	Faster resolution on the phone. Currently it takes about 20 minutes on the phone to resole any Lenovo issue
else	make it easier to contact customer support,  It was really hard to firgure out how to contact you, it wasn't even in your website.  Once if found out how to contact you, it worked well
else	because of the keyboard malfunction of my laptop, I suggest that you should improve your hardware and ensured that the OS is updated and it has a complete drivers.
else	pls also to provide software support after dismantle problem hardware parts from the CPU.
else	inferior product - even the replacement parts is unreliable and low quality, another rubbish from China?
else	I am disappointed that my original 1 month old accessories (AC adapter and power cord) were not returned, instead older accessories were sent.
else	Be better prepared with spare parts
else	Increse the service centres in chennai.The online technical support has to be educated
else	Sent the defective phone on Monday, received a replacement on Wednesday.  Thank you very much.
else	Accurately express technical issues and service related issues.
else	make sure you have the correct replacement part
else	Hardware parts are of inferior quality. I encountered past terrible experiences when comes to computers are not able to boot up, LCD screens have dead pixels across the screen and the black spots which is consider as Consumer Induced Damage do not reflect the actual issue of whether is Consumer Induced Damage or manufacturer's fault.
else	More detailed updates, rather than email subject lines with no body.
else	My X1C5 had an issue the second month after purchase, I don't know how I managed to get defective machine and not being able to return or get better treatment than regular slow depot support. The process it took to finding out (i.e. navigating poorly designed websites, got thrown around by chat agents) was stressful. Therefore I don't think I can recommend Lenovo product due to its chance of getting defective one and the poor after-sales service to anyone I know.
else	The telephone menus are a little looking ng and confusing
else	By shortening the time to send a technician for issue resolution.
else	Send the correct reolacement part to avoid two technician visits and shorten time for resolution
else	Give service and on time
else	Support personal are very friendly.Online updates never worked for me. I could not check status. This resulted in me having to call in after over a month. I was told that there was a wait on parts. This should have been notified to me by e-mail instead of having to call wondering what's going on. My tablet was returned today completely by surprise as I was never informed that it was fixed or shipping back out.
else	Since my laptop was still under warranty (less than 9 months old) I would have appreciated a shipping label to send it to Lenovo instead of me having to pay for something that was a  quality issue
else	The engineer didn't have full knowledge of issues. I had dual boot in my system which didn't work properly after the part was replaced, the engineer had no idea how to fix the problem. The laptop (windows) became very slow afterwards, to this too the engineer had no solution.
else	I received no service on the phone and no one responded to my email, utterly disgusted I have been left with a piece of junk that doesn't work
else	The machine has been returned by your service centre and is still not working
else	Use SLA's  Have all parts in stock. Make quotes up at point of contact not sent in email one week later.  These are basic customer service standards.
else	More communication and updates would be helpful, more detail about what's going on.
else	Make it easier to contact the correct department and less onerous to provide customer information
else	Faster return of laptop under warranty.
else	I had about a four to five minute wait, but it was worth the time.
else	"Give more leeway to technicians who come to the site. The technician who came to my office knew what the issue was but told me that tech support would not send him the part without ""troubleshooting"". It would be easier to send the technician parts they request and if the part is not used, they can return it back to Lenovo."
else	Identify the carrier for the returning product to the customer.
else	Be faster with laptop repair
else	Not pass me on to Microsoft who are impossible to contact!
else	Call waiting time
else	Fix your phone system.  Is a Lenovo yoga tab a Think or Idea product????
else	Keep in contact when it takes longer than 3 days
else	update us any issues
Agent	Multiple disconnects
else	They sent the wrong parts multiple times. After a month on waiting for repair, the technician recommend I ship the PC directly to Lenovo repair center for resolution.
else	Issue logged dated on 18-jan-2019 and engineer visited date-21-jan-2019 but issue not resolve properly then again engineer visited on 31-jan-2019 for post part replacement, issue resolved.
else	As I said earlier in this survey, call me and I'll provide you with the details.  I'm sure that other people are having the same problem with the way your warranty coverage dates are established.  I'm seriously considering calling Matthew  Zielinski in North Carolina to let him know how customers are being treated.
else	Improve the time of back orders of your warranty replacement parts.
else	Better to reduce the waiting days of technical service.
else	make sure device works and Bitlocker resolution is available
else	Make it easier to reach customer service by e-mail; return phone calls at the pre-scheduled time; make the procedure for requesting service clearer, and easier to find out online without a lengthy phone call
else	check computer thoroughly before returning
else	More feedback on what caused the problem. Also diagnosing if there are other issues with the laptop that I had not raised.
else	Phone Tech did not order the right part and should have asked more questions. The Service Tech that arrived knew right away the first part would not take care of the issue and ordered the right part.
else	My problem didn't resolved instead gave me an excuse which clearly shows the lack of knowledge.
else	Check device on the day it is received. Upon replacing system board, do complete diagnostics. When I brought up the issue with your complaints department the man blamed the assumption that ssd data would not be touched to be the reason, the system board was not checked. He implied that not touch ssd data meant not testing ssd hardware interface with system board. He even blamed the front desk colleague for not making it clear.
else	Quicker response times
else	Shorter waiting time on the phone.
else	We were waiting for parts. But no service was scheduled after the part arrived. It's only scheduled after  i called to inquire the part status after one week.
else	The support team still did not contact to me !
else	faster repair and supply of parts
else	Test the product before returning. The mouse touchpad is not working and it was working before. We need another box to mail it back in please. ASAP
else	Better technical support.  I was provided with a series of checks for my computer problems.  I may not be technically inclined to conduct the checks and resolve the issues.
else	It takes two attempt for engineer to resolve this issue, so I can suggest Lenovo to improve their engineer technical skill.
else	your chat support is very very poor technically and am not familiar with the specs of your products. They gave wrong information. I had to call direct
else	give us an update for delays
else	Explain the return process better.
else	No updates were made and I had to initiate conversations to see where the process was.
else	waiting for a part
else	pay for faster shipping speed, have more cohesion between departments
else	Not disconnect a customers when they key in the digit to get to the correct support department
else	Don't keep me on the line for three straight hours in the heat, transfer me to three different support staffers, then hang up on me.
else	Shorter wait to speak to live person
else	after the repair, my laptop looks like a damaged second hand one, with a lot of distortions. Until now, no one promises me to fix ithttps://forums.lenovo.com/t5/General-Discussion/concern-about-thinkpad-quality-and-repair-service/m-p/4054349#M36340
else	Am from Karimnagar, Telangana state, India.  you should update address. Wen services senter is changed. in online is showing old service senter address. How can we now service senter is changed Pls update.
else	this is the third time my laptop was returned for the same problem.   Provide a permanent solution before the warranty runs out.
else	Better technical support, better communications, simpliar return process, better shipping conditions.
else	Better status update; faster support
else	Supposed to fix the problem 3 times been sent back a fourth
else	Waiting for Lenovo to call me back with technician info
else	Quicker resolution
else	tell what was wrong with the system upon return
else	Don't charge $300 for a keyboard.
else	Just a minor thing and as a suggestion... the emails I received, automatically generated, could improve the Portuguese language writing. It's not a question of not understanding the message, just not written correctly. As it is automatically generated, probably using a template, it's easy to have it write properly.
else	provide parts that don't go to hell a week after they are replaced.
else	Improve response time
else	Having to make several calls to pay for a return.
else	My computer was returned to me in worst condition than when I sent it. I was locked out of my computer and have not been able to gain access to it.
else	Better inventory of replacement parts.
else	Shipped damaged part three times. STILL waiting
else	The product seems to be vulnerable and particularly robust for daily office use.
else	There was no communication after I logged the case, I then just received the parts in the post with no word on when an engineer was going to show up. After i requested an update on the case twice i rang you directly and only then did they schedule an engineer to come out. The part that was delivered was DOA so the engineer said they would order another part and come back out but the same thing happened again, I received the parts but no engineer. I AGAIN had to call and only then was a engineer scheduled to come onsite.
else	In 1 year i repaired my laptop 2 times it means the parts of laptop are not trusted
else	Provide better status tracking for shipped parts
else	Improve repair time (mine went over the 14 day rule),  allow more choices to customers when waiting for extended time repairs (I was told to just wait for 2-3weeks), improve on same messages between personnel (some time someone would give me an option whilst others would say there are no options), improve on reporting defects in a timely manner (not 3 weeks apart)
else	Don't damage my laptop even further when it's in your repair centre, and repair it when it is faulty and not squirm out of the repair by saying it's not covered and want to charge me 169
else	spare parts delivery time should be shorter
else	swifter resolution of missing part replacement
else	The initial name of the company was incorrect and thus the part was received one day later. Ghost Transportation Services was Ghost Tax Protection Services :)
else	better and faster statues updates
else	To take minimum time in delivery of part expecting to be within week.
else	Give some efficient tool to engineers who came for service cause in my case some scratches on my laptop's body are seen after service, it's a new laptop and it had scratches and so it is some unsatisfied service experience.
else	wrong part shipped and I don't believe this is the problem
else	I have not  received that laptop yet and Lenovo team sent the laptop to  nowhere! that's ridiculous that you are sending a survey for a case which is still in Progress! and your support team has not done anything to resolve the issue. I am completely unsatisfied from Lenovo on this case. I want to escalate this service request.
else	Did not completely solve the issue- Have to return to the store late.Tried calling hotline and email, no one ever picks up or rely back. When hotline calls me instead, I asked for ETA, which should be a really basic thing and they were unable to provide. Instead they told me they'll get back to me on that and call back the next day; They never did.
else	Better standard operating procedures (sops) to govern the timelines,  process and updates made. From the incident,  the technician had failed to make the necessary repairs and had took the laptop to the centre on the 24th of october and came back with the unit still being unable to boot on the 1st of November.  During the duration the laptop was at the centre,  no updates were being made and we were left in the dark on its status and whether timelines were being met.  It is also frustrating to note that the issue has also yet to be resolved despite the laptop being less than a month old.
else	I was unhappy to not receive a replacement watch of the same style. It was bad enough I couldn't get my original watch back with a new battery. Too expensive as well.
else	Lenovo didn't assist me or the Tech Team that was supporting me over the phone. They dodged responsibility when it was a Lenovo update that caused the issue, causing the Tech team to need to reimage my machine.
else	Provide progress updates during servicing
else	Giving more updates on the status of the request
else	the laptop returned from service depot with the trackpoint damaged!
else	return all my items I sent in box all at once
else	Not getting updates on time.. Motorola; a Lenovo's company had promised that it wil give oreo update to moto g5s Plus but didn't get it by 3-4 months  When you can't stand on our decision than don't give fake promise...
else	Take better notes or where to ship the itemMost knowledgeable techniciansFollow up when issue is not solved the first time
else	Faster response and resolution. Like DELL.
else	improve response time and provide some basic software support, particularly on hard drive issues.
else	fix my computer faster
else	The part which was to be changed , new part which executive brought at my place was Have some defect.
else	store essential parts such as batteries closer to large urban centers. Just my office building alone has over 500 Lenovo X1 Carbons.....
else	Get service people who work the phones to be polite. Also, introduce local service centers and not send in service only.
else	By having better software and updates .
else	The service centre did not do thorough technical evaluation before taking in the handset. After pointing out a flaw in their misrepresentation I was handed over the phone without needing to pay for the repair.
else	Tech had to come back 3 times to fix problem - 1 time was wrong parts delivered. Not even slightly close to what was needed. This is hard when the user is down for so long.
else	Telephone rep specified incorrect replacement part so tech had to reorder part.  Reordered part was defective so he had to order another one
else	Send a replacement prior to requiring the unit shippped back.
else	"Increase technical competency.  The recommended troubleshoot steps were things I already performed, and some didn't really make sense: ""Turn off sleep mode""???  Provide more flexible troubleshooting options that don't involve me driving across town to have a technician troubleshoot my laptop during my business hours."
else	Nothing was fixed, so called to send I'm. Tech was supposed to come to me, and I am STILL waiting.
else	I have only received 3 out of 6 chromebooks that went in for repair. I still have not received labels for 2 more that were on the list of 8 chromebooks. I called last week and spoke with someone who told me another person would email with instructions on the 2 that labels and boxes were not received... and I have not received an email.
else	The Machine was returned without having the issues addressed . It is actually being sent back for Depot Repair again . Note that it is the 4th time in the 1 year since i own it.
else	Awaiting for repair assessment
else	Make it easier to locate/contact premier support services; improve status/actions update notification.
else	effort....if someone would have typed in the serial number and read the history of this machine would understand that it might not need to be sent back and make EVERY means possible to contact the customer.   I am a Lenovo Warranty Repair Depot and i am the tech that fixes warranty's for you guys.  i would hap that would have a little more weight when getting machine looked at.   and the machine was returned DOA so there is that.   this laptop since it was purchased about 8 months ago has been a total shit show of issues.  customer wants her money back for the laptop REPLACED...and i do not blame her.  and the email said that they needed to contact me to approve charges....its under warranty why would the customer have to pay to fix something that is clearly not their fault.
else	Keep parts in stock locally.
else	It seemed there was a lack of coordination for getting an engineer to site to replace the parts, the engineer had to come from Jersey which also added additional delays.
else	tech support employees need to listen to the problem. your support phone number needs to be clearly listed. the volume on the phone was very very low
else	Have Spare parts in stock - Initial part was defective and am still waiting on a replacement
else	48hrs resolution time .
else	I specified a service address during my talk with lenovo support, but they did not update the address. I had to talk to the service tech to have the address updated.
else	better updates on site and when I call, I expect the person answering the phone to have the ability to either find or get answers about my service.  And, when they say they're going to follow up with an email, I expect to receive that email.
else	a faster turn around to have repairs completed and returned
else	It took toooo long to return my desktop back
else	A small damage to base part to laptop is happened while disassembling the laptop.If small please look in the matter
else	Fix your phone tree! It is very frustrating and time consuming to navigate.
else	Took half an hour to reach technical support over the phone
else	Speed up the resolution time.
else	"Make sure every thing works on laptop (it seems ""fn"" key may not be working)Email me when you receive laptop and let me know when you expect to get it back to me"
else	Item returned with the same issue
else	reduce the amount of backordered parts. Test parts to make sure they don't arrive dead.
else	I want to update my Lenovo laptop warranty but after 12 I am unable to get  the proposal
else	My laptop was shipped to  the wrong address and I never received it.
else	More support technicians on live chat support to reduce the wait, a better courier to remove the need to take an entire day off, a service center that actually has the parts to repair issues and better quality control at the service center so that a laptop doesn't leave with more issues than it came in with.
else	The first call I made the representative was very slow and hard to understand. He mistakenly told me I had to cover the shipping on a warrantee item. Eventually he promised me recovery software, verified my address several times and yet I never got the product. The second time I called was the opposite. The representative was intelligent and had knowledge of how to send me the waybill for return. The call was a fraction of the time and she was very helpful. I was able to send my pc, but I have not heard about it yet. I am being patient since it's the busy season.
Agent	I bought a brand new laptop and from day one it would disconnect from wifi. Called tech support before my 90 days and they wanted to CHARGE me for premium support. How about you warranty defective devices.
else	I have lenovo k5 note there is no any update to this phone.
else	Improve resolution time
else	Have returned the laptop for service three times in 6 months.
else	If the part or technician is not arriving within a few days you should be emailing or calling me, not me chasing the status of the issue.
else	No service received. Its on your paper only. Booked for a battery replacement of my handset moto X style on January. Waited for 2 months but battery was never provided and was informed that it is not available. Got refund of my advance payment but I wanted battery to make my phone operational and not the refund after waiting 2 months.
else	Please improve your service quality and Also change your technical team some are very polite but most are not.
else	Still waiting part and now happened again
else	Service Engineer replaced the part but the cable packing are not proper, post mother board change touch pad is not working and from BIOS mother board serial number and UUID details are showing as invalid
else	Bring all the parts the first time, not the third.
else	The first person I spoke to on the phone was not very helpful, sent me a part that I did not need and would not send On site service. Second time I spoke to someone was much better, sent correct part and technician right away.
else	I sent in the device in April to be repaired. It is almost August and I still haven't received my device back.
else	Have a real time process tracker for tracking package and when product will be expected to be shipped back to customer
else	order the correct parts from the first time.
else	It has been a month since you were contacted with the details of the equipment failure, NO REPAIR HAS BEEN PERFORMED. Additionally, at the initial contact no repair order number was provided, we had to call back to obtain it. No updates have been provided regarding the status of the repair, at a minimum you should be making contact once a week to advise us on the delay.
else	time frame to repalce faulty part have to be fast
else	I called to get help with my tablet that has been malfunctioning since a few months ago. I bought it in October of last year and I was told the warranty expired in September of last year! I was then asked to send proof of purchase which I did.  No replies have been made since and I have tried to call back with no luck.  Also the option to get a callback didn't work because I never got a call back.
else	Keep more parts available.  I was without my work computer for over 3 weeks.
else	A week was a bit long to wait for resolution. Service Tech was great.
else	Make sure that all repairs are complete do checks to see if there are other problems other than what was originally reported to avoid having the customer go through having to resend the computer for multiple times
else	more auto mated updates on what is happening.  When delays happen, it shouldn't be up to the client to check the status of the repair.
else	havent been updated by Lenovo and why so long and not resolved?
else	Lenovo could be more organized in regards to matters of status updates. I've called/emailed/live chatted with multiple agents and got a different story every time ALL IN THE SAME DAY. Nobody really gave me any helpful information and I never knew which stage of repairs my product was in until it just showed up at my door.
else	laptop is still not working- MOBO replaced and problem now looks like the battery is bad, going on a week plus with no laptop as the parts are backorded
else	just keep spare parts more accessible
else	Speed of service, reminders to send back device, ease of returning device.
else	Lenovo could make it easier to get a tracking number.
else	return my computer in a functional condition.  it had to have the motherboard replaced under warranty, but came back with a bitlocker program installed which I can't get past.  followup was to restore the hard drive which will lose all my stored data.
else	It took too long to receive my pre paid shipping label
Agent	Better wifi adapter that does not disconnect from router
else	"Provide more opportunity for ""guided self help"". My impression is that my problem was not a hardware problem -- though I thought it was -- but a recognized consequence of installing Windows updates before installing Lenovo driver and BIOS updates. If that is true, I could have solved the problem myself by doing a factory reset and reinstallation, without waiting for the return box to arrive and shipping the computer to Lenovo and back. That said, I was impressed with the speed of the turnaround."
else	I have called multiple times in the past to change info on my service request and these attempts have been unsuccessful
else	Expedite the delivery of parts.  I waited for a month to get the parts delivered and when it arrived, the motherboard was DOA according to the Lenovo Tech that came onsite to do the replacement.
else	The replacement part had the same part number but was missing a rivet for a screw to hold down the wireless card. It has now been shipped to the depot.
else	increase the technical support engineers numbers.there is only 2 engineers service center
else	Except customers feedback & stop saying design name for product quality issues
else	My computer was returned inoperable
else	Fix the problem before returning item to me so I don't have to keep mailing it back.
else	Faster service, better customer service, faster shipping on devices fixed
else	Make sure tech has correct parts.
else	It was hopeless you need people who know what they are doing I contacted Lenovo twice and the issue was not resolved   One person I spoke to said he Wud send me an email of the solution and it never arrived.  Then I foned again and the person I spoke to did not resolve the issue SO I phoned a local Computer person and within a few minutes he resolved the issue which I had to pay for.  Lenovo support is not good. Get good people that try to resolve the problem on the fone
else	As soon as I ordered, I started having problems - my unit's delivery was delayed because there were no parts. 2 months in, my SSD broke and I had a terrible experience with customer support - first it was impossible to find the appropriate number to all, and when I finally did, I was spoken down to and told that the fix would be a factory reset. I was told this by TWO agents, while another one told me to send it to Best Buy (which doesn't work with Lenovo support in Canada), until I finally got hold of a lovely person who told me I would need to send my unit in to be repaired. Since then has taken over 165 days to solve my problem, as I sent my unit in, it was repaired, and a couple months later it broke down again- and I'm still not sure if the unit will break down again and require more repairs. After the second problem, customer support was difficult to find yet again, and though the service was lovely (I was offered extended warranty and the agent I spoke to was very kind), the repair center was missing the necessary parts so I was left without a working laptop for almost 2 months. Quality checks need to be much more intense both when sending units out initially AND when sending them back from being repaired; the support numbers need to be much more accessible; and you should ensure that support agents are ALL trained to be as helpful as the 2/5 that I encountered. 3/5 were some of the worst customer experiences I've had, while 2/5 were really lovely, but I never knew what I was going to get.
else	The latest return was not at all addressed by the service team, simply re-imaged and sent back to me.  Such a big waste of my time!
else	part quality should be better
else	Try to deliver parts as soon as possible.
else	Reduce the delay between report of issue and contact to set repair appointment.
else	Because the faulty part has not been replaced yet. The replacement part received was DOA.
else	I will not use your services again in the future because of how unsatifsfied I was with the service I received
else	I tried calling multiple times to update an error in the shipping address: this issue was never resolved and the error persisted throughout the duration of the case. I was bounced between multiple call centers numerous times when I tried to resolve the problem - please fix this in the future.
else	Send instructions to return bad item; inform customer that another part may be needed.
else	Had to call back and reschedule never heard from you
else	make more better your customer care executives and  trained for professional support
else	bring all necessary replacement parts like extra battery
else	Technician didn't have the part with him on first visit. He then proceeded to try everything I had already tried myself and had also done at the prompting of tech support. The problem was fixed, but the speaker is still very quiet and the technician was unwilling to engage that issue since it was somewhat out of the original scope.
else	faster fix time, fix at first attempt, advance communication of time engineer plans to visit
else	the delay between identifying the issue and resolving the issue was less than ideal, but the final resolution was great
else	Have spare parts of producs sold in each country.  International warranty should mean it.
else	send in someone with the product knowledge.
else	u need to deliver the products on time ,you almost took 15 days to complete my work.
else	Too slow, Lenovo parts not available took over 3 months to collect and repair and return.
else	After software update My mobile cundetion in worst then before
else	issue was not rectified, I kept on receiving emails that the job has ended and if the issue was resolved   I replied that it wasn't... but kept on receiving these emails with a final email stating that since there has been no response from me, the case file would be closed,   i'm guessing these were all automated emails with no one actually looking at them
else	Stop charging customers to return laptops to you for in-warranty service. Use HP type service. If the problem can't be fixed over the phone they send a tech to your home.
else	Better quality control of new laptops and of replacement parts. Quicker service.
else	no one came onsite
else	Not a lot other than reduce the waiting time on calls
else	all good/ more communication regarding feedback
else	Complete on line without having to telephone for returns number
else	Sent wrong part after 3.5 hours on phone and now asked to call back again (last time switched back and forth between departments being told other dept had to help me)
else	Speedier response once a call has been logged.though we know parts are not always readily available
else	Lots of bugs in each and every update ever released by Lenovo. Very dissatisfied with the services offered! WILL SWITCH TO REDMI!LENOVO SUCKS!
else	Provide any update at all.  Notify me when not showing up. Update your hold music so that it is not interrupting itself with multiple overlaying messages.
else	Better services, support and quality..You guys making me fool last 1 month.. no follow up at all.. no updates.. no support...
else	My handset is not working properly within 1st 8 days only...I have repaired it for 2times and though it is not working properly and m very dissatisfied by buying this piece ....
else	Initally, they didn't provide regular updates, I have to call them daily asking regarding it. But yeah at the end of the day they fixed my mobile that's more important.
else	Don't sell us an on-site warranty for something that will always need to be shipped to Depot for worlds slowest fix.
else	Give me consistency on part arrivals/install time. This has nothing to do with the tech, this has to do with communication between the service desk and then how it gets relayed to the tech. I was told by the dispatch center that I would get next day install, but the tech could not do that and I had to hold it off for a short time. If the dispatch center told me that the tech will arrange install at the time of the call, this would not be a complaint.
else	Better quality on spareparts, better onsite technicians, my problem is not solved yet.
else	1) Improve follow-up, 2) Communicate status changes to customer, actually begin the repair when needed parts come in instead of waiting for customer to call for status.
else	Give at least one update to let me know item was back ordered without me having to keep calling you. Also tech damaged plastic covers on screws while replacing screen.
else	I received a new Moto smartphone at a minimal price. The service was fast and efficient.
else	Online diagnostic correctly diagnosed fault, but the 'raise service call' button remained disabled, I had to separately raise a call and paste the relevant details in.  Apart from an autoresponse, there was no followup, but then a replacement battery arrived, with no paperwork.  Fitted it, all was good, machine returned to use.  Then an engineer turned up to fit the battery.  In summary: you provided what I needed, but communication sucked!
else	Do service first and make call for feedback
else	better communication after service call has been placed... often times we have to call back to get the status update!
else	Have replacement parts in stock. Notify clients and update them on replacement part status.
else	Faster response times, onsite technician to resolve issue.
else	Better call center environment so customer service reps can communicate better with customer
else	I dont know why the heck its not fixed, its been sent in countless times for the same issue
else	When I checked the status of my repair it had indicated that I was notified of no warranty and that we were responsible for the repair. However, I did not receive said notification. I had to call and was told I would have an estimate for the repair within a couple of hours. I had not received it by late afternoon when I left work and had to call back the next morning and request it again and finally received it several hours later. Communication of evaluation through the beginning of the repair was lacking.
else	Provide original parts for replacement
else	"Ask the right question/details at one go instead of dragging it over 3 weeks. Have one point of contact. Provide valuable update instead of ""searching for a replacement"", do you not have visibility on stock details?"
else	There is something wrong with my laptop and it has been wrong since I received it.  I was unwilling to remove everything from my computer to mail it in and the local warranty repair place never called me back.  This whole purchase went bad from day one.
else	give the god damn engineer privilege to fix and change the parts of the damaged laptop ,because the engineer visits the place and understands the gravity of the situation with his own eyes in person ,but no they have to ask and seek permission form a person who is in some place else and is not present in the place where the product is ..a snapshot is not enough to explain a situation ,the build quality is very bad in my laptop ,fragile like an egg ..the coat on the touchpad wears off super fast ..worse than a cheap hp laptop..the material feels like a stationary toy and gets damaged even with slightest of actions .
else	Please refer to my feedback on the previous page.
else	Provide tentative update of the replacement delivery status.
else	Better testing before returning product and more service locations. I had to take my computer to the service center twice, which amounted to Four (4) Three hour round trip drives from San Francisco to Fremont to drop off and pick up
else	nothing on this call
else	Keep parts in stock
else	The suggestion solution was not successful, was ruled out as a potential fix by myself and the Lenovo certified technician, and Lenovo refused to send additional replacement parts
else	I did not receive all components that I sent in back with my laptop. Then I had to call to get the components sent to me. This took 3 phone calls. 2 of which I waited on hold until the system(I HOPE it was the system) hung up on me. Then when I finally spoke with the rep it seemed they were aware that the part was left but had not taken any steps to get the issue squared away.
else	More testing prior to returning the laptop to me.   the issue occurred within the first couple of hours of use both times it was returned.Also - if the laptop has been in for two repairs and the issue recurs, the replacement option should be offered.
else	I was very disappointed the laptop I just purchased had a damaged screen when I received it.  That being said, my expectations were exceeded when dealing with the screen replacement.   It only took a few days for the laptop to be returned to me in what appears to be like new condition. Great job service team.
else	Progress tracking, shorter turnaround, better information on my options
else	"Not Sure - But I received a defective brand new laptop and was unhappy.  I did send it back for warranty service and they returned it to me ""Supposedly"" fixed, but it wasn't fixed and finally they agreed to send me a Brand New laptop and I am still waiting for it.  It has been hard to deal with business with my old laptop as it is too old and I need my new laptop."
else	It took too long waiting for the parts and I had to follow this up to find out where the parts were before anything happened
else	Fix your service department.  Honor advance exchange warranties.  If the model has been discontinued, replace it with the current equivalent or better.  Changing to onsite, then waiting for back ordered parts is not an acceptable solution.
else	Still waiting for a computer we ordered more than a month ago.
else	Recall should not need mail-in
else	I am awaiting reply to E-mails to new problem Google out of date.
else	Have more parts available. And technicians ready to provide technical support.
else	"Please follow up our comments in regard to 'software updates"""
else	My computer still is unable to update and has long lags, even just upon startup
else	I do not remember this specific call.
else	Tech failed to call at agreed upon time to schedule on site visit. Duty Manager contacted. Tech waited until appointment time to call and say he was going to be an additional 30 minutes late. Tech did not screw the laptop back together, visibly loose screws. (All the bottom case screws had to be tightened by the customer.) Technician service was overall very poor.
else	quick action and not wait for hardware parts
else	It took a while to hear an update about my case from Lenovo. I had to call after a week for an update after not hearing from them.
else	"Your representative found a way to fix the problem but the method of resolution took two weeks to resolve. Secondly, the behavior of your phone representatives was completely unacceptable. They called me ""sir"" and I am a woman. I clarified and asked them to call me ""ma'am"" and they continued to call me ""sir"" at least 4 more times in that conversation. They were dismissive and did not even acknowledge my request when I asked them for the 2nd and 3rd time to not call me ""sir""."
else	Keep customer updated and sort out very bad courier service and inexperienced call centre staff
else	I am still waiting for the laptop to be repaired and returned to us.  Seems a bit daft sending out the survey before then
else	Try to fix the issue of the mousepad getting messed up by a Window's update
else	You will have to resolve the issues on time
else	2 No call no-shows for on-site technician. The last time the tech showed up he did not call and came in the evening without warning when Richard was expecting a morning appointment as discussed. This was an atrocious experience. Especially for Premium Support!!!
else	have parts in stock.
else	I would want them to be more on time and be more responsive to the calls.
else	less part replacement delays
else	First of all, don't send me a survey that doesn't even apply to my problem.  My problem did not involve phone support AT ALL! You sent a technician to replace my mother board - twice! The only time I talked on the phone was when the technician called to ask if my PC was available to work on. So not only did it take two attempts to fix my problem, you then send me a survey that shows that you didn't even know what happened. Is your company really this clueless?
else	It would have been better if it was first call resolution. I hated that my service ticket was closed and was not notified.
Agent	Shorter hold times
else	Better testing of rebuilt parts, like a 24 hour powered on test.
else	Please exchange this laptop (call pending for 2 months) with a new laptop of same or better model or return my money in exchange for the faulty laptop (in warranty)
else	Returning the accessory we shipped to Lenovo and did not receive back. Also factory resetting the system before shipping it back would have been helpful.
else	more updates on status of problem resolution
else	Send the correct parts.  They only sent one stick of ram, luckily my ram was still working.
else	Non technical staff..
else	slow turtle speed work and still problem was not fixed
else	Resolve issues the first time the depot receives the laptop
else	email update needs to be faster. I received the product in the mail and got the email tracking update 1 day after.
else	send all the parts not just one by one
else	I wish the letter I received was a bit more personalized.  It would make it extremely personal if you gave me a diagnosis of the issue with my device, how it's been fixed and what I am getting. I thought I was getting my old phone (the fixed version) but had to go through a lot of trouble to find out it was a new one.  This would have been helpful to know.  I do like the ease of the process and the speed at which Motorola resolved my problem.
else	Faster parts delivery
else	Male short the phone options
else	Better technical skills of online / 800# personnel.
else	It would have been useful if someone contacted me either via email, phone or updated the service ticket. But I heard nothing. I know my laptop is out of warranty but some communication would have been useful to advise what the error message relates to and options available to resolve (even if there is a charge involved)
else	"At this point I have the following case numbers related to this specific issue: June 29, 2018 - 406HCCF; July 24, 2018 - 406LZN7; August 1, 2018 - 406N8NW (Current case number).  Initially the laptop was returned to us with the headphone jack not working following a depot service (June 6, 2018 - 406CHVB).  There was little to no communication initially and every day we called we were told it would be ""escalated"" with no resolution.  The Lenovo Customer Care rep had let us know that a replacement part was sent to the local repair tech on July 2, 2018, but we didn't have anyone come to our location until July 24, 2018.  I had called Lenovo daily during regular business hours from July 11 - 24th to get status updates on if a tech would ever show up to complete the repair, each time being told the ticket was ""escalated"" even though no one ever came out to repair the laptop, sometimes I would get a call back that no technician could be sent to repair our computer on that day.Specifically for this leg of the issue, it took from July 24, 2018 when this call was created, to July 31, 2018 before we saw an onsite technician for a next business day repair on a part that was in stock, and had been received next day by the local repair technician, according to Lenovo Customer Care."
else	No one has called back and my laptop is still broken
else	After submitting the ticket for repair the on site tech never showed up or contacted me. I had to resolve the problem myself to get the computer ready for deployment in our company.
else	Waiting for part takes time
else	It was not corrected by phone.  It took 3 days, 3 different people before I sent it in for repair.  Maybe if the first day, the person left notes as to what was tried the second person would have believed me when I told him I had already done this, making me redo everything so that it took into the third day.  Total of 3 days before decision to send in was a waste.
else	May be u can more proactive and attend common issues in more professional way.
else	More frequent updates even if no news.
else	Speed up the process of the shipping & return of the computer.  It takes too long.  Maybe e-mail a label so we can ship it the same day if we have our own carton.
else	Hire US citiz0ens to take calls who udnerastasn English
else	resolve the issue on first call.
else	Tablet was missing 6 external TORX screws, 2 screws and a retainer plate for the camera, and 3 other internal screws when returned to me. The device was also having issues with losing power when not connected to the AC adapter and I found that one of the pins connecting the battery to the motherboard was bent over.
else	remember that we are not all computer geeks when trying to do a fix over a telephone line
else	I never received a notification that my item had been received by Lenovo technicians.
else	Every time--and I mean every time--I spoke with a Lenovo technical support person... they TOLD ME THE WRONG INFORMATION.  SEVERAL TIMES I WAS TOLD THAT MY WARRANTY DID NOT COVER THE SYSTEM FAILURE, THAT THE WARRANTY WAS ONLY FOR PLASTIC PARTS THAT COULD BREAK... THE LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE THE TECH SUPPORT HAD WAS TERRIBLE!
else	Send someone, as no one came. I called and was told by the person that I had to schedule within 5 business days. I wasn't free during that time, so it didn't work out. He said that I would need to open up another ticket with Lenovo if I wanted to schedule the service for the sixth business day.
else	Improve the phone support part of this service
else	Just need to communicate a little better on backordered parts.
else	I'm really not sure what this is referring to. I never spoke to anybody over the phone from your company my laptop had to go in because the right click didn't work I have no idea what this survey is for
else	Never send  defective part  to customer  before fully tested even a single part is damaged so kindly send it with fully tested and check from bangalore head office or from service centre because its effect the company image and reputation for the future  for the company
else	Shorter phone wait times.
else	We have been switch to Lenovo brand past 2 years. we confident and believe on the service and product which reliable for our business. But we disappointed with the service that , we cannot claim warranty for the motherboard.
else	Took too long to return the phone
else	Provide timely updates on open cases
else	I think it was a case of the representative I spoke with figuring what part I needed but somehow it just didn't get shipped after the call.  I called back almost two weeks later to check on the part and was told again I would receive it in 3 days and that time I did.  So maybe better communications or follow up between person on phone and person doing the shipping.
else	Faster phone resolution
else	ensure to have parts ready for a popular item
else	Took long time to get accepted to return computer
else	I had difficulty understanding the technician during the first call
else	Repair turn around time is far too long, sometimes taking multiple weeks.  In this case I was not sure if we would ever receive the depot box, but eventually we did receive the box and were able to ship it out.  If I could fix this myself without voiding the warranty I would have, but since it was under warranty we just dealt with it.  Compared to other vendors warranty service needs to be greatly improved.  Other vendors can get us a depot box within 1 or 2 days, and have a fully repaired product back in about a week.  For in-house repairs, I can get parts from other vendors and have a warranty repair resolved in under 3 days.  With Lenovo, I don't know what expectations to set for customers because sometimes it takes over a month to get warranty issues resolved.
else	Send out tracking information for the package.
else	Auto email update on the timeline to get the quote for repair.
else	It has been about a week and I have still not received my phone back ,the workers at service center are not punctual either I had to wait a lot ,it is really  really worst service center
else	Solve issue before returning product
else	they change the part but problem still remains
else	They part shipped was not the issue at hand; we were sent a memory module for the unit however the diagnostic revealed a Hard Drive problem read write issues a replacement part for the hard drive is required
else	Provide the correct parts the first time.
else	to allow the telephone call in for technical support
else	Minimal waiting time, properly attended, received call when it was done
else	The problem was the bad interaction between a Windows 10 update and a common Lenovo laptop. The update had to be rolled back. While the problem was fixed, the service would have been perfect if I had been given proactive advice on what the future holds: how do I stop Windows doing it again? when (if ever) can I accept Windows updates?
else	Keep your product and services updated
else	return our charger
else	Wrong part was shipped.  Courier said they would send the correct part in couple of days. Still no part received.
else	Lenovo can improve my experience by having parts in stock, not making the problem WORSE after the first visit, communicating, and thinking outside the box when a technician breaks a functioning laptop and then disappears.
else	Stop sending repeat emails and sending the delivery guy twice when product was already dropped off, that's even after confirmation email that the product is received
else	Incorrect depot repair..no resolution yet
else	Make the process more clear and indicate that the caller needs to inform Lenovo when the part arrives in order for a tech to be dispatched.
else	The issue was not properly troubleshooted and the product was returned to me still defective
else	Software is not working,  updates issues,  gets hanged up.... Require to reconcile o>erational issues
else	Quality of the sound and calls is something that can be improved on.
else	Quicker resolution and provide a spare unit when needed
else	Faulty new machines should be repaired in a Lenovo workplace rather than sending the customer a new part to replace himself/herself.
else	Be more interactive and professional in providing service.
else	Give adequate updates, be responsive, not give your customers a run around to different departments that don't speak to eachother.
else	The digitizer of the replacement phone I received is not functioning at the highest level. I have occasional ghost touching and unresponsiveness.  The only surefire way to remedy this aside from patience is to reboot the phone and even then it is not always perfect
else	It is better that you will send a technician who is knowledgeable with the support solutions for the possible defects of your products.
else	I think that lenovo could improve is in terms of the booking of slots for the timing to come to the customers house, I feel that it was somewhat messy where I was inform of the meeting on the day itself but thankfully was able to reschedule the date.
else	Please update warranty period in time.
else	This was a complicated situation with no clear responsibility for what occurred - the wiping out of the IMEI number during a routine Android update. It could have been blamed on the carrier (T-Mobile / GoSmart), Google Android or even the vendor (Amazon). I had contacted the carrier and Amazon to no avail. Motorola was big enough to shoulder this one, which really surprised and impressed me. They sent me a replacement phone. Unfortunately, there was a miscommunication and sent the phone back with the battery and the back phone cover. I informed Motorola and they sent me a new batter and cover. It then transpired that they also sent back the old back and cover! I also got to talk to real support people and very helpful ones at that. The support was outstanding - something unusual these days. I have shared this story with my Facebook contacts,
else	Calls to update status of the case
Agent	Be more polite, willing to help without being arrogant and condescending and down right rude
else	Problem was worse when returned.
else	Replace broken parts faster than 1mnt
else	provide a canada post shipping label
else	Need to Improve part quality
else	Pay for shipping box and more updates on status.
else	Laptop repair took 6 weeks and then was returned damage and needed to be sent back.  As of today we STILL do no have the laptop back.
else	We like Lenovo but technical support has been awful! I have had an issue with a computer for over a month and still have yet to get any type of resolution.
else	I waited a couple of weeks anmd part had not arrived. I did a reset on m/board and that seemed to fix it
else	should have communiation between departments. Have alist of options for resolution or offer that some one who can offer a solution would call you back
else	Make the returns process more seamless. I had to reschedule the Fedex return and this meant I had to make numerous calls to arrange this. In the end the Fedex company still arrived at the incorrect date as it had not been corrected on your side. When the item was returned the issue was still present on the device.
else	recruit professionals staffs, they only know one solution . formatting your computer as whole, which repetitively makes it slower.
else	incorrect part was sent to technician
else	the ticket said they called me but didnt, I had to call in, not the first time or the last time this has happened.
else	Please try to solve all problem in device what i mentioned, or if it is not possible please give feedback about causes!
else	Well if there wasnt a fault with it in the first place i would not have to contact uou.
else	Inform me of the steps taken during the process so I know what to expect when the product is returned to me. I wasnt informed that the hard drive would be replaced rather than fixed until it returned so I had lost everything that was on the broken hard drive.
else	Make sure that all techs have updated BIOS, to perform the Machine Type and Serial Number available to perform the changes.
else	Speed up the replacement part delivery and keep some stock for the spare parts
else	Not take the customers parts when you leave, show up when you say youre going to, when managers are supposed to call me, that can actually happen, meet the timelines your own techs lay out and dont open multiple cases for the same problem
else	Speeding up the resolution time rather than response time
else	It took over one month to repair while waiting on parts
else	Also, still waiting for a part. Spent hours running tests and damage outside of warranty was claimed despite knowing that was the issue and it wasn't accidental damage
else	The issue is still unresolved, they were able to send a LCD to counterpart services but still the problem exist
else	track customer issues after reporting, not waiting customer phone, mail for further steps...
else	if you choose online chat sometimes the wait is very long. Occasionally since we're service technicians and we're very busy we fail to notice that the agent has picked up his end, and they give up and disconnect before we can get back.
else	Please improve communication about availability of parts and engineers
else	Stop using third party vendor to service lenovo devices. Worldwide services was under par
else	Better communication eg delay was due to a part being ordered but this did not get communicated. I only had 1 hour's notice that the engineer was coming. I was previously told on a Thursday that it would be no later than the following Monday but this did not happen.
else	Time taking in service / part delivery must be improved.
else	I didn't even get any service, when I called I was told there was a problem due to weather and some one would call me back.  No one did!
else	Replaced system board three times--Perhaps better parts.
else	I expected my service to be completed without me having to make multiple phone calls that 'esclated' my service.  I kept watching the online updates but my service was not progressing, then when I called, the service moved to the next level.  Then, I had to call 2 more times. It took over a month for my computer to be fixed, which it way too long.  Also, have the parts in stock.... you are the manufacturer of the product you should have ALL parts in stock.   This delayed my service as well.     I shouldn't have to babysit my service on the computer.
else	could not get to support staff on the phone.
else	One of the replacement parts was not included in the service.
else	keep the client informed about expected ETA on parts and service calls.
else	The only bugbear/issue I had was beyond both of our control. There was a communication/phone line delay with the conversation. It was like the old-fashioned one way at a time, air traffic controller, voice-activated communication. Sometimes I could not hear/understand what the Tech was saying, & probably him as well. Probably to do with the distance between both of us.I will say he was very patient & considerate. VERY well done.
else	The only issue I've had since sending my laptop was that I was not notified that a part was on back order and for how long. Once I called for a status yesterday, things moved along nicely. The resolution is excellent.
else	Make sure all drivers work with Windows 10 updates!
else	Still waiting for replacement
else	Send replacement parts that are not defective!
else	Kindly arrange the parts asap
else	Be more responsive by returning phone calls or emails when promised.
else	My computer previously stopped working and when I received it the headphone jack stopped working. It would have been better to not have another problem created after my first problem was fixed.
else	It seems like the time it took to receive the necessary parts was extra long.
else	System running slower & slower compared to first time use; it was affected with lots of and routine updates alert by system from time to time when I on the computer.
else	Better updates from support.  Hire more Lenovo repair guys, the current ones are always super busy.
else	Follow parts recommendation of technician and not close the ticket, instead of forcing me to open a new ticket to get it serviced. desktop is still not in working order after 1 week from first call.
else	Send the right part the first time and when you don't, on a 3 week old computer send a technician like I asked for it to fix it!
else	They do not updated me the status, and I tried to call their given number and never answered. Also repair took more than 10 days.
else	Resolve after 1 call.  This resolution was perfect, but it required me to track it for a week and then call back in.
else	Improve repair times
else	Downgrade my laptop OS to Win 7 Pro as stated in the service form attached to the mailing box(while the same service was declined by the repair third party because they were authorized to do so).: contradictory and confusing statements.
else	Improvement in sound and camera quality
else	The runaround that I received on the phone was unacceptable. Customer support --> Think Tech Support --> Sales --> Parts Replacement --> back to Sales --> Encompass -- only to find that was all unnecessary as when I called back a few days later, customer service was able to handle my issue. Also I would have expected a faster turnaround time. I had to get transferred to another representative because this was a business purchase, so they know the machine is used for work. 2 weeks after the case was created, I had not heard back regarding shipping. I finally called to check on the case and the expected delivery is 23 days after the replacement order was created. This is an incredibly long amount of time to go with neither a computer nor any communication.
else	Please test the device carefully, I am a software engineer and I know the basic knowledge and don't give me execute that it is software issue. I monitor without windows update and regular update. Now it is happening back again. All about using this laptop is watching movie and using microsoft office only.
else	My laptop was sent in for repairs and so far I've used it 4 or 5 times since getting it back and no issues .
else	Include a tracking number when the part is shipped.  It took 5 business days for the part to arrive, not 3-4 business days.  Shipment had the wrong apartment number on it, but fortunately my neighbor contacted me.  Box used was way oversized and included additional part that was not needed.
else	No one contacted us
else	info given does not respond to my question
else	Computer was returned and immediately failed again
else	speedier fix times, more communication, ease of delivery of items
else	Would be nice if resellers could replace parts such as motherboards with proof of adequate knowledge in the form of a test. Serial/model programming can be done with publicly available tools on the majority of modern systems now. In my case, I did the flash/programming myself as the tech that was sent out did not have the knowledge to do so and I did, realistically making his presence completely unnecessary.
else	still not received any update after email send 16 days
else	Provide a product that works straight from the box and does not require updated software to be despatched by CD with a delay of 2 weeks
else	Shorter wait time on the phone.
else	When new parts are issues provide serial number of parts to customer by message. so they can recheck it before replacing the parts by service engineer. it help us to identify wheather parts are authenticate or not .
else	wait time
else	Better testing before returning an item from the depot.
else	delay spare parts for 20 days
else	Make the support contacts more obvious on web page. Have to search a bit for them. The ability for Lenovo to find my product serial number and model number are terrific and eliminate my frustration for  having to search for them. I am very pleased overall with support experience and the quality of customer service I receive.
else	Like i said better feedback to the client.
else	"Properly training telephone support staff on how to assess problems being described by customer, having telephone support staff who speak more clearly and communicate in a more efficient way, not attempting to get money out of a customer for a service that is completely unable to be rendered because the problem being described makes the computer completely unusable, creating a telephone support system that doesn't require the customer to jump through a dozen hoops before speaking with a human, NOT EXPECTING CUSTOMERS TO BE ABLE TO REPLACE PARTS TO THEIR LAPTOP - this is an important one, the part I was ""supposed"" to be able to fix on my own was 1)not something I could have accomplished on my own 2) not even the problem with the computer (it was the motherboard not the hard drive), had I attempted to fix it I would have caused more damage due to my inexperience and lack of knowledge, my laptop is my life for work and school I cannot risk breaking it because a company wants to save money on techs I purchased a warranty for a reason"
else	Faster turnaround for parts
else	Make working products and offer better service over the phone
else	Provide better updates for drivers / softwares.
else	Shorten wait time to speak with a Representative.
else	Getting the parts quicker or giving me the option of a new computer because mine was only 3 months old before it died.
else	I did not damage my unit however, I had to pay the shipping cost.
else	Some of the emails I received were confusing. I received emails saying that my laptop had been received at the same time as the email containing the shipping label I needed to affix to the box before sending it in. I also got a link to the UPS tracking website, when I had received a FedEx shipping label.
else	better updates during wait period
else	The brand new laptop arrived with a faulty trackpoint and trackpad, and the warranty replaced the motherboard. The repair was quick and effective. The only problem is that I had to pay nearly 10 for the box and bubble wrap to ship it to lenovo. This effectively has made the laptop more expensive and I've had to incur a cost to have the laptop repaired within the first month of purchase! Not only was I left without a laptop for a period of time (incuring costs due to time lost), but had to incur extra costs in shipping it. Lenovo should provide the box to ship it, especially if it's within the first month of purchase. Or at least a small refund for the inconvenience caused. I bought a lenovo because I expected reliability, instead I received a faulty laptop and had to pay up slightly more for it to be collected... The repair itself was fine but I think you can improve the customer experience. Many thanks, Lucaa
else	Expedite with spare part and arrange person with in 48 Hours
else	issue with part that had to be changed and sort of . Could not tell me much about the refurbed parts. not enough background on the refurbed parts.
else	Still haven't received it back
else	Provide updates on status of case.
Agent	I was on hold for long periods when phoning
else	Be more explanitory on the phone about where to go in order to talk to a representitive about how to fix your product.
else	Do it right the first time!  Do quality checks before sending/returning machine.
else	I was disappointed that my phone had a warranty and when I had to get it replaced I received an referbished phone. I just got my phone in March now I'm paying for a used phone. That is very disappointing. These phone cost alot of money I really don't like paying full price for a used phone.Besides that complaint,I really like Motorola phones.
else	this was second fix, required new key pad and mousepad
else	It seemed like there was a delay in getting the part shipped, so maybe that could be streamlined a bit. I do not know all factors involved in the process.
else	"Nothing was resolved on the phone. I opened a ticket to get my X1 Carbon inspected following the recall announcement. Shortly after the ticket was opened, it was immediately closed. So I had to call back to set up another appointment. Since it was then later in the day, it made my ""next business day"" service another day later. The second phone rep could not see why this ticket was closed. How could a recall service be completed over the phone? Makes no sense."
else	I got my computer back, and it clearly had not been tested before returning.  Therefore, I was surprised and disappointed to discover that it booted with a message to provide a Key I.D. for a Bit Locker.  Now that I have returned it, you are wiping my hard drive.  Very disappointing.
else	Not for this particular issue but In general there is delay or send wrong parts
else	Time to get a replacement unit is too long
else	For minor issues, on the spot resolution would be desirable
else	Provide new replacement parts not refurbished.
else	Please send your Service Engineer with spare parts to make functional my PC as my complain since 27.08.2018 has not solved yet.
else	No technician ever came.
else	Unlock my computer for me/send detailed letter when laptop was returned
else	lesser time to wait for connecting the call to technical person
else	The part was backordered with no timeframe and then case was closed.  Service was done elsewhere.
else	wrong parts sent out first time. due to mistakes by Lenovo the right parts were delayed being sent out, now waiting for engineer with no fixed date for them to come out. after over 3 weeks with the machine not working this is unacceptable
else	I received parts via post but no notification what was going to happen next - it then took over a week for the engineer to contact me. When he did the parts were incorrect
else	Give regular status update.I was told it will take 5 business days, my laptop came back after 15 days
else	Clearer instructions for device return.  Email confirmation should include details for return .
else	Need a solution to this particular Thinkpad. Has been a challenge since purchase. Part of the problem remains unsolved.
else	Be on time always and solve the issue on first visit
else	still waiting for reply as promise in Sammy Shang email dated 25 June 2018
else	perform testing before returning. treat the laptop with more care
else	Laptop spare parts should provide better
else	again, communication about part delays and making sure case notes transfer across would have went a long ways in this case.
else	Be on time!
else	Improve communications with your customer especially when something is delaying the return of their computer.  A simple email is all that is necessary or provide a link to your site where one could check on the progress or understand any delay would have made my satisfaction a 10.
else	it would be more helpful if the support web page can update the status in real time
else	Improve quality control of parts. Speed up the repair process. Communicate better to customers as to what is happening.
else	Fix my unit
else	Lenovo needs to ensure that your on site tech is profession and clean.  Need to ensure that there techs are knowledgeable
else	Be more clear with email notifications in regards to when parts are back ordered.
else	I am waiting for solution of my laptom
else	Repair and test item before returning
else	The pc although able to boot up still does not work as it needs a further 8gb to update Windows 10
else	Problem diagnosis and triage taking too much time with too much overhead of process overhead is curtailing efficiency of your technical support team. For under warranty or new products, if technical support asks end user to run diagnostic tests that span over more than 24 hours with continuous human interaction - this speaks volumes about the inherent 'don't care' attitude of Lenovo to its newly acquired customers.
else	Problem difficult to find an agent the official phone french number direct you to a fax line.  WHen an agent is available the service is good.  It took 3 or 4 phone calls to be redirected to the right person.  He was very good.
else	Provide parts and support in timely manner. I paid for next day support and the device was fixed 7 days latter
else	The parts took a really long time to arrive.  Everything was fine after the parts arrived though.  Would have been nice to have regular updates so I didn't have to call in to get an update.
else	Serving on time to time
else	Provide status updates and actually answer phones at the depot.
else	The device was returned and the issue still exists. The problem was never fixed.
else	multiple attempts, issue reoccured, new problems occured, waiting for the 4th attempt
else	the only really frustrating part of the experience was that we had a terrible, I mean horrible telephone connection and communication between the expert and myself was near impossible. I had to repeat myself so many times I did wonder if my problem would be sorted out, but with perseverance, we got there.
else	Better Service, Satisfaction, In Warranty Providing same latest version part which one you  replacing, Resolving problem in one attempt, if they can't able to solve problem immediate forwarding the issue to higher authority and find final solution.
else	Hopefully this was an isolated incident, but the first representative I spoke with was difficult to understand on the phone and he sent me a shipping label with multiple spelling mistakes. FedEx was unable to fix the shipping label and I lost a few days because your team chose to ship me a new box instead of a revised label. This was very problematic because that is a work laptop and I was unable to perform my duties effectively throughout the repair.
else	Faster resolution. If this were an HP laptop with problems I am confident (from past experience) that the replacement parts would have been dispatched almost immediately e.g. second call. The pace at which this support request has moved is inferior to HP and seriously undermines my confidence in providing Lenovo solutions.
else	My laptop has return for several times. The living chat and phone is hardly to successful connect and the factory not read the note so the early time they do not fix my problem.
else	The lady I first spoke to ordered the wrong part, they need to first schedule a technician to check the unit out then order parts
else	My issue was a simple fix that should have taken 5 minutes on the phone, but instead took 3 hours on the phone. The 2 support technicians I spoke with were not well trained in troubleshooting.
else	- Make it easier to contact support via email.- Provide hardware diagnostic tools to address this particular issue (fan test was not selectable).- Provide BIOS and hardware test binaries independent of operating system that work on USB keys (rather than n

else	have the correct name and phone number. when I specifically gave mine because my boss wouldn't be around to answer the phone, they still called her, so the call was missed the first day since I wasn't on the receiving end.
else	increase the processing speed and keep update me hows the process
else	1-  The phone connection quality made it extremely difficult to understand the technician.2-   The remote control 123 rescue.com sent a tiny icon which was virtually impossible to read.  The technician also was not aware of this and did not tell me to enlarge the icon so that I could agree  to this session.   Therefore, we lost a lot of time trying to do a remote session, but finally I saw that there was a feature  on the icon to enlarge it  and see that there was an agreement to click on. This was a great time loss for me as well as the technician.
else	Need to improve in part shipment
else	there was no response  or updates from the service center after the job was completed.
else	Provide extra assistance - 2 tabletvreturned due to no charge (was the explaination) however it must be st fault if Lenovo charger which hasnt been replaced or discussed as an option. Only that I need to charge it. I know how to charge a device so the charger must be faulty

else	Make it easier to get updates, the website asks for Case# + email but doesn't work.  The information provided doesn't tell you if they found an issue or how they resolved it.  I was forced to call in to get the information I needed and even then the information was limited.  I asked to speak to the technician and was told I couldn't.  I gave specific instructions on how to reproduce the issue but the person on the phone would not relay the information to the technician.
else	Shorter lead time for parts
else	Make parts more available.
else	Please replace the Hardware within 2-3 business days else update the status to end user.
else	Just be better about status updates and time estimates.
else	Package product with better insulation when returning to customer
else	Better communicated the dispatch of technical  services. There was no email to inform customer of the service window - I received a call from technician saying that he will be attending to the job 2 hours prior on day of the job. I was just fortunate that someone was at home.
else	Need to get another part
else	This is the second attempt to fix the problem. It is still not resolved. Perhaps its time for a new laptop, since the current one is unfixable.
else	The lady Irena Mihaylova did not know what she was talking about!  and she did not raise the call the usual way.
else	No instructions or disk cloing software provided with the SSD I received.  Unable to do anything mroe.
else	Showing up when scheduled.  A visit was scheduled for Monday 12/10 - part arrived - no tech.  Still awaiting arrival
else	Need to have a callback or way of reconnectiing
else	Make shipping of parts quicker
else	Keep customers updated with ETA - didn't arrive when expected
else	Actually fix the issue after sending the computer in 2 times for the same problem.
else	According to the technician, the replacement part was shipped to the wrong location for pick up.  This delayed my repair by 2 days.  Fortunately, my device was still fully functional.  I also was unable to use the online service request option
else	Actually fix the computer and send the shipping label as you said you would 4 times and never did. So I shipped it myself again and am hoping you honor the expediited repair and return you promised.
else	The laptop was still defective and I returned it and requested my money back after multiple attempts at resolution.
else	When there is a need for replacement of some part it takes long interval to get the part from company. So it is a kind request if  this time interval can be reduced, it will be more helpful for us .
else	It took 4 FAILED service calls for a tech to actually come replace our part!  to improve....HOW ABOUT GET HERE ON THE FIRST OR EVEN 2ND TRY!?!  HECK, EVEN THE 3RD!  WE WAITED A DAMN  MONTH FOR A MOTHERBOARD TO BE REPLACED. THIS HAS BEEN A SHODDY EXPERIENCE WITH YOUR SUPPORT
else	the multiple unit rma process is a bit redundant.  there's no reason I should have to email the information that i've already given and will be sending in again with the unit.
else	Provide updates that are clear and regular if there is a delay
else	Staffs at the service counter can be more professional
else	There was no confirmation that my computer was ever received at the depot. My computer was delivered on January 24th, but wasn't marked as received until the 29th. The website used to track the status of the device was never updated telling me the progress of my device. The Help from the online chat techs was very helpful and they were all very kind.
else	Have stuff arrive on time.Send the equipment to the tech instead of the end user.
else	Better care in development of critical updates.
else	Faster turn around time and sending all parts back with the device
else	the length of time before the technician came out was longer than expected
else	Give a correct date for return of my order. Your confirmation letter said that it would be returned by 1 January but it didn't arrive until 12 January
else	I contacted Lenovo nearly 2 weeks ago as a scan of my desktop indicated that the hard drive was failing.  Lenovo confirmed that and they indicated that they would contact me within 3 days and send someone out to do the repair. I called last week to follow up as I had not heard back re email or phone as they said within 3 days I would be contacted.  Still no email or phone call to confirm when it will to be replaced.
else	There was initially a miscommunication with the person in the office I had been emailing and the engineer, so the engineer first came on a day when I was not available. However this was quickly rearranged to a time that suited me, which was great.
else	I continue to receive Moto Projectors that are not working. It is ridiculous that this continues to happen. Never again will I do service with Motorola ever again.
else	Quicker turn around once the product is received.  Complete reassembly and quality check before return
else	your call centre needs to be more knowledgeable about issues. I called twice and neither time they were able to permanently fix the issue. They told me to return the laptop to where I bought it. But I went on google and found the solution myself that fixed the battery issue for good.
else	I choose the model based on wed site information, which grossly misled me to buying a product which was below my expectation. I also had several technical glitches spread over two months. An option to replace by  another product would be better to improve your brand image.
else	qtly feedback.
Agent	I was provided wrong information by the first agent, apparently Lenovo will not collect my faulty laptop. I spoke to the retailer, who tells me Lenovo will take six weeks if I pass it back to the retailer rather than send it directly to Lenovo. Terrible experience, and I'll probably never buy another Lenovo again - and neither will I use them in my company.
else	Make sure that software updates are compatible with previous versions.
else	I received my replacement phone with no issues from anyone. I was also happy with the representative who took the time out to call me a couple of times to make sure I was assisted and received my phone.  He was very courteous and professional.  I also sent an email asking for the status of my order and received a prompt reply to let me know the order was still being worked on.  Great job!
else	Can give more updates about progress
else	"During a phone call to tech support I was guided through the update process.  We updated the drivers and that didn't resolve the problem; so we reset the computer and that didn't correct the problem.  After completing the trouble shooting process with tech support I was authorized to return my laptop (at my own expense!?).  When the computer was returned to me a note was included stating that the repair process was to update the same drivers I'd already updated - it didn't work when I did it and doesn't work now!  That I had to return this at my own expense is unacceptable. That your tech followed the same update procedure that had already been documented to be  unsuccessful and the just ""called it good"" is insulting. You've failed miserably, I'd like to be contacted by someone that can, and will, actually resolve this problem.  ."
else	Faster delivery time of parts to service center
else	You might have contacted Microsoft to provide a better answer.
else	I really like my device but support is cumbersome to reach over the phone and process of having the average client replace their own wireless cards is misconceived. What should have been a 10-minute repair for a tech professional will now take my device offline for weeks.
else	Stop your technical support its totally headace
else	When sent in, I told them computer is super slow when I received it, still super slow.
else	slow charging within 1 hr service repair,god experience
else	better communication, customer updates more often and coming from Lenovo. Speed of dispatch engineer to site.
else	honor service contract, return product
else	First chat was advised they didn't know part number I'd have to call parts Dept. I found a parts list for my system online on my own and ordered a charger (cc charged, still no part). Email advising shipped tracking number linked to error message. Called ( on hold for about 45 min) was advised there was an error and she would get back to me. No response or part since then.
else	I think it is time for Lenovo to replace my laptop. I have sent it in five or six times, and the problem keeps reoccurring. The people I dealt with were very helpful and professional, but, I have purchased three additional years of coverage, and my work is depend upon my ability to have video conferences and I cannot qualify or quantify the inconvenience and damage this has caused. very frustrating. I have been a loyal costumer of Lenovo with my past few computers, but i am losing faith.
else	Part was not deliverEd till today and once again the wrong part was delivered! You sent the keyboard when what is needed is the trackpad
else	Give status updates via web portal or email
else	It can be better to have the parts available on the first on-site visit.
else	I did have a long wait to get through on the phone line (16 mins) then as my details were being taken the line went dead!
else	It took several call to complete, several times being given incorrect information and the device that i received as a replacement is no better than the one i already had. Battery life was no better if not worse.
else	Received the part with no instructions on how to install
else	ticket closed without resolution.
else	Provide good after sale service and improve your parts quality . If after 4 days if any one needs to replace laptop screen then its better to avoid lenovo products .
else	Every part of the experience was bad. This represents the worst customer experience I have ever had. It was almost unbelievable. It was almost as if the attempt was to try to make it as bad as possible. I spent several hours on the phone. One time I called 4 times in one day and given different information and direction each time. I wonder if some of your support service actually comprehends? I am known as a very patient and understanding person - you would really need to review the history of the many tickets it took to do one simple thing. I fully expect my warranty to be extended for the original warranty term as the laptop was broken when I bought it and I should not be expected to start my warranty with a computer that didnt even work correctly in the first place. What a terrible experience.
else	Repair update online was not updated as per depot status. The depot status was very difficult to obtain. The depot line was seldom free and the voice mail was malfunctioning.
else	it was damage part - Keyboard
else	update the website with details. speedier turn around
else	Work on creating faster turnaround for repairs. Follow up to ensure repairs completed were satisfactory. While my initial issue was resolved, my computer is now much slower and having new issues. It is less than a year old, and I do not have the resources to continuously send the product back in for additional repairs.
else	It was under warranty but they told me it was not updated and update the warranty by sending email.
else	Replace the part. It's STILL not replaced.
else	I have since returned the PC - still waiting for PC to be returned
else	We are a school district and we had several computers that had the same exact keys fail. We tried getting in contact with you before the warranty ended but no one returned our calls. We failed to return these before the warranty was out. However, this is obviously a factory issue. I was told it was against your policy to repair out of warranty computers. We understand, however, we also understand that you could have easily repaired them or replaced them. You didn't help us and your product failed.
Agent	Reduce time on hold
else	Improve shipping instructions / make sure shipping is received and delivered on time.
else	Speed and response
else	techinical team need improve knowledge
else	Do not release firmware updates without testing. Do implement a fall-back fail-safe mechanism that allows rescue in case your firmware update fails. Fix the damage you cause immediately. Do not make the customer do a full re-install of the OS. The laptop was shipped with a pre-installed OS, so one might think that this shouldn't be beyond your capabilities.
else	Ensure updated contact details are sent through to customers.
else	Give frequently update of devi
else	A shorter wait on the phone. Needed two attempts.
else	Wndos 10 consuming data insted of Auto update off. When given servicee center they are saying problems will not resolve because of windos problems. Even i have to talk Customer service  of Lenovo. They also saying.we cannot resolve the issue. I have to talk Microsoft.i m expecting to resolve problems by lenovo but not support anythings.
else	there was a long wait for a part that was out of stock
else	as i was told it is not h/w related issue and there must be some bug with the current version of operating system,i have to wait for the bext update
else	quite down the congestion noise in the call center
else	There was no status updates and no service order number. I had to ask for updates through email.Took one week. There was no warning that my laptop had already been shipped back to me and I nearly didn't receive it. No option to start the repair process through email or chat, only a PAID phone line. Unacceptable.The model of my WiFi NIC was changed without warning.
else	Better call center - faster return.  And customer does not pay to ship
else	The Lenovo technical hotline Support Agents are not very experienced with what they are saying. One of the agents in fact just closed my case and marked it as solved. I had to contact another Support Agent to help me reopen my case and escalate it so that an onsite Technician will come and help meThe Support Agents all followed a very strict standard of procedure and these leaves customers feeling very frustrated because they are not answering to our questions.For my case, I said my laptop battery only last 3hours and the hotline Support Agent told me 3cell battery can only last 3hrs based on what their system said. That is not true because no laptop can only last 3hours. The onsite technician came and resolve my battery issue by replacing it with a new one. Even the technician with many years of experience repairing Lenovo products find it unbelievable that a laptop can last a mere 3hoursIn future, I would like all Support Agents to first listen to their customers before reading whatever information they might have on their helpdesk to the customers. The customers are the one having an issue and we call in to ask for help. When you first purchase a laptop from an Official Lenovo sales promoter, they will explain clearly what the product can do and what it cannot do. We the customers understand this when we make the decision to buy the product from you, Lenovo. The problem arises when the product fails to meet minimum requirements after we purchase it. It is only logical for us to call Lenovo Hotline for assistance. The Support Agents and the Sales Promoter, they both give different information. It doesn't matter who is wrong or right. All Lenovo staffs should have the same information to better help the customers. When the sales promoter say 5-7hrs of usage and the support agent says up to 3hrs of usage. That is a very big difference!I hope from a reputable company like Lenovo, there is no False Advertising on the side of the Sales Promoter. For the Support Agents, I wish they are more patient when handling customer requests. Customers keep calling it because the problem is not resolved, so please do not dimisssed us if we want to follow up with you.
else	Need and waiting for system update
else	Provide solutions for issues, especially when caused by Lenovo's BIOS update.
else	Fill in the on-site technician with what's going on with a computer before sending him parts that won't fix an issue.
else	Give me the part you told me you would send me.
else	have more parts on site
else	The speed of resolution and the quality of the replacement
else	More replacement parts available in the country to avoid sending small items. Furthermore, the technician spent a lot of time to replace a laptop back cover, since he had to replace all antenna's, webcam, and the related cabling to the new back cover. It would have been much simpler, neater, and faster if the replacement back cover would have already have at least the antenna's.
else	provide online status update
else	provide an engineer on site not only phone or trouble suiting on phone
else	Returned with different problem/error and was told to return. Box wasn't sent, had to call again but have received no follow up email with status.
else	Tech wasn't givien all the parts needed.
else	To fix problems faster, month for fixing the corrupted laptop is too much. In addition my computer interrupted to work with same symptoms about two  weeks after returning from lenovo lab.
else	Test your products with latest operating system updates before rolling it out in market
else	poor understanding of my dilema and the need for a resolution.
else	Keep parts in stock so it doesn't delay delivery by two weeks
else	I received my laptop with severe scratches on the panel. Furthermore the speakers were not working anymore, which is strange considering that my laptop had to ne repired  due to problems with the display. The display problem was also only partially fixed. The display backlight was lightening uneven.
else	First i ordered for moto x play turbo charger but didn't received charger more than 2 weeks and they gave me different charger after two weeks of less power output rating.
else	Manage the delivery of parts and notifications better. We often receive notifications that parts have arrived when they haven't. They usually turn up anywhere between an hour and 2 days later if at all. The last 8 or 9 requests we have made for parts have not arrived. I alone had 5 references in addition to this one all logged at the same time. The re-opened calls are also already outside of both estimated delivery dates provided.
else	Everything. First contact was OK (suggested downloading drivers and blocking Windows updates !!??). No change. Second contact merely suggested buying more RAM and (without diagnosing anything) ordered a backordered system board. Tech arrived when it eventually arrived, (he was OK)- by then we (the customer) had diagnosed that it wasn't actually running slow, the problem was that cordless mouse function (3 different ones) was actually the issue. He ran diagnosis (everything checked OK) and... we still have the same problem. Total clown show. You call this service?
else	too many error and so many days to wait for parts
else	It was a long wait time just to chat with someone and when I did get to talk with her (him?), she seemed very distracted. The ending of the conversation was also quite abrupt. I purchased my machine in the US and had a question about windows software, but the support person insisted that if I had further issues I had to talk to a Switzerland-based help center because that's where I'm currently located.
else	make the process to update warranty information easier.
else	provide updates to os
else	My warranty is expired ,my phone software updated at rupees 500 is too high amount compared to others company.
else	Better status update posted online. I shipped the laptop to lenovo, but the status online continued to indicate it had not yet been received. That prompted me to have to call in to validate that it was in fact received.
else	Engage better part delivery courier agency
else	The quality of sound in the call was not clear enough to make out everything that was being told. Must have been something with the headset.
else	There's nothing you can do. I returned the product and purchased an Asus. Been satisfied since then.
else	The service center is not equipped to handle any technical issues. The issue was with the power adapter as they were unable to test the adapter they have switched some other part.
else	Fix the issue, not leave the building with the part you shipped to me and say you can't replace it for whatever reason.
else	Be more professional in communicating with customers.
else	timeframe should be faster for parts/ improve the quality of the devices
else	We received the phone quicker than I expected
Agent	You can't put people on hold for 30 minutes before answering.
else	No feedback from technician when he is coming, he just appears with no appointment
else	Send an acknowledgement email indicating when action will be taken within 24 hours of a request being submitted.
else	Warned me or organised so Windows 10 did not conflict with Avast on this unit. Saved hard drive. I seem to have lost some speed? Some problems with sending email.
else	send an email when material was received and when when was sent back
else	First, don't schedule an appointment if you don't have the part, and a part being on backorder shouldn't prevent the service from happening.
else	Better communication Laptop was returned and is not working. Has the same issue as when sent out.
else	was sent the wrong part twice, still waiting for the proper part
else	Faster and effective way to get help to resolve any technical gitch
else	Your telephone techs are terrible. Your in home service policy is terrible. I bought it and you refused to send anyone out.
else	Actually ship me the product and also let me know when it will be arriving and not close the case before I actually receive the part.
else	return a phone call when saying you would and keep me informed of the situation
else	Listen and make sure you understand the problem when presented and then address that problem when the item is returned so a second round isn't necesary.
else	Do services on time
else	Make automated responses easier & more simple to understand.
else	Make sure your third party repair people know that they cannot replace a motherboard on this type of machine.
else	Improve product qualityProviding replacement immediately instead of waiting for retured faulty product
else	I received a replacement phone without major delays or challenges. It was difficult to get the new phone set up and online instructions could have been much clearer and more helpful.
else	My phone was not turning on ..Getty stuck at optimising app ..and for that they said they will flash the phone and they required 3-4 days for it ..then phone was showing out of warranty don't know why ? They asked me to send bill Amazon order list etc and they will try to correct the warranty time by contacting Lenovo team but this will also take 3-4 days ...
else	They didn't fix the computer and returned it more damaged. I've lost my harddrive and all my info and lost work over this.  I should be compensated and not continually have to return a damaged product,  it should simply be replaced as it's a lemon.
else	Less wait time before a rep answers
else	Send instructions on how to remove the old part and install the new one
else	send functional and correct repair parts to the tech.
else	Keep parts in stock. When I pay for next business day service and it takes weeks to come in, I should have paid for the slower service.
else	Observe ans test software updates prior to making them available for systems to download either manually or automatically.
else	It was the third time I had visited Lenovo service center..this time it seems it is repaired..and the staff behavior was also not very good..they use to fight
else	I haven't needed to contact Lenovo
else	Improve on wait time
else	Lenovo should minimize the response time to 24-36hours after received report.Warranty claim should be settle within 7days from the day customer submitted case.
else	Repair the mentioned and NOT return the pc broken!
else	not to transfer phone back and fort few time
else	The technician who came over my house does not speak much. Technicians should give more advise to customers on how to prevent problems on laptops and not just do the work and leave without saying anything. There is no value-added service. This goes same to your call agents. Call agents only answer when customer ask but did not initiate to give additional helpful information to customers.
else	Make a more direct path for return authorization when it involves an issue that is unusual.  It should not matter on a brand new computer whether the issue is a hardware or a software problem, it's a brand new Lenovo computer.  The customer should not be expected to have to trial and error different procedures, especially someone who is not computer savvy.
else	Nothing to my knowledge
else	Please provide updated notes to include the online Depot ticket for review.
else	the machine was returned with Windows 7 on it when I originally had Windows 10 installed.  What a hassle!
else	PC not working at all when I received it back
else	Please provide the affected parts sooner than over a month.
else	More customer service linesStatus updates
else	the damage on my computer was not covered by the insurance we have on the product and that delayed the return as payment had to be made. I don't understand how the screen is not covered and it costs so much to be fixed. Not having a computer for such long time was horrible as I wasn't able to work.
else	I receive a replacement for my broken phone.
else	They don't have proper knowledge of their work
else	It took a long time for the courier to delivery the spare part. Even after the working hours were updated, courier always came in the off work hours and it took almost 7-8 days to deliver the spare part.
else	3rd. part issue not tech. 3 times replaced. Lenovo always send refurb parts. Some are dead on arrival. its annoying and has happened a lot before.
else	The wrong part was brought the first trip, even though our IT rep requested what needed to be changed
else	I called got the help I needed and I send my broken phone in and received me replacement in less then a week. We like the products and warranty is easy
else	Ensure parts being supplied do not arrive DOA for technician.
else	Poor in making time appointment and calling to check on the matter.
else	Send fully working parts and better instructions.
else	don`t take notebooks for repair and keep the customer wondering about the status; repair faster
else	Still waiting for part, or alternate solution
else	Keep the tracking information current. I never knew when my computer was done.
else	The service person who arrived was stellar, but the Lenovo service was horrible - I had to call repeatedly to get updates on status, was kept on hold for lengthy amounts of time, given conflicting information & it took a long time to resolve. Your company should provide status & tracking via email, without having to call since you clearly don't have the personnel to handle the call volume.
else	Stop sending me surveys and calling me. The guy fixed my computer just fine and i got 3 subsequent phone calls about it and now an email. This is super annoying.
else	I visited the service centre 9 times within 3 months and my device was damaged by the repair engineer 2 times.Pathetic service.
else	I got multiple calls but the issue is not resolved. Recently I got a mail that issue has been closed But actually it is still unresolved
else	Be more careful with my product as it got scratched multiple times while away and also it took weeks for this repair
else	We received a phone that is not charging properly. There seems to be a loose connection near the charging port. We tried multiple cable including the original Motorola cable.
else	Don't charge for shipping for in-warranty product, repair faster
else	Dont send the wrong part
else	Nothing that I can mention right away , though only for the contact office in Belgium to be more accessible. The number they advertised at the time as customer service number, from the message in English, had some digits missing, so I could not contact them. I had to contact other customer service numbers, until I was finally helped by your UK office.
else	Update your online portal and read and action customer updates
else	Lenovo should pay to ship the non working unit back for repair, not the customer. I requested several times on the phone to speak to someone in the United States because I could not understand their accent. They refused to transfer me. One of the women told me to call a number and It had nothing to do with Lenovo. Tech support ran me through the same steps that I went through the first two times I called for help. The problem was never solved.
else	Give customer an alternative delivery option for delivery/returns
else	They should keep customer updated about service by msgs or calls
else	Have a fix for the problem of reactivating a mouse pad after Windows update.
else	Everything, it took 2 months to receive the laptop and nothing was done and my touch screen is still not working
else	To respect that I need the tablet for my professional presentations and fix it faster!
else	speed up part delivery
else	Slow response from technical team. Need improvement to reach customer
else	Technician onsite was spot-on when replacing the faulty parts. However, the 2 different issues reported in one report had to be resolved in 2 visits is quite time consuming. Would be more pleased if everything resolved in single visit.
else	Service is very slow, staff also do not have much knowledge
else	Do not call customers to fill the feedback forms.
else	Show up on time. Show up at the time agreed upon by the tech and the customer. Have parts in stock. Ship parts to the correct address listed on the ticket.
else	Deliver parts a bit faster in cities like Aligarh,UP
else	Upon returning device the LCD was damaged, this was fixed but the primary reason for the computer being sent in was not addressed
else	Prepare the product change/cash return forms better
else	I had to wait nearly 3  weeks because of a system issue you had regarding credit card processing/  Needless to say, this was very frustrating and I could not receive a replacement for that long, having to purchase another replacement in the meantime.
else	I was supposed to get a call for a repair, never recived one. will not use or buy lenovo products again.
else	Teach your technical team how to solve problems rather than aggravate
else	I was told I would receive a call in 3 days but never heard from anyone
else	Put the premium service telephone number prominently on the internet.
else	I couldn't understand the lady on the telephone
else	Better customer service - tablet was DOA almost 3 weeks later still waiting for replacement!
else	"shorter wait time on the phone and some suggestions on how to deal with the windows 10 ""cluttered"" ""fussy"" program"
else	The phone returned had the same defect is the one we sent in.
else	Please consider upgrading laptop so such employees receive better machines and smooth business is promised on time.
else	The refurbished phone you shipped me is not in good working order, the pictures come out blurry in Auto focus and the Microphone cuts out when skyping and using what's up app, I did not have this problem with the phone I returned to you. I need to return this phone now.
else	"Send a competent tech who will ""own the problem"" until resolution."
else	Incorrect parts arrived with engineer
else	I'm a little disappointed that it would have cost me $25 to receive the replacement phone before sending in my phone that had a problem. Having to borrow a used phone from a friend so I didn't have to pay anything was a pain.
else	Due to the technical fault of wrong warranty information registered at your end I got a lot of trouble and got delayed by mire than 10day  .
else	Deal with the root cause of the system failure that prevented shipment of parts.
else	"After purchasing next ""business day on site warranty"" for quite a sum with the laptop, we were disappointed to be informed that the intermittent disk failure and error with this laptop was deemed 'user serviceable' despite our requests for an engineer to look at the laptop.We ended up having to ship the laptop to the supplier with the part once we received it, to have it repaired and shipped back. A thoroughly disappointing experience with Lenovo, considering how much effort they have spent over the last several years trying to get into the HE market. After sales support is just as important as sales tactics for customer loyalty.In previous instance of a Lenovo laptop having had issues with a disk (and an engineer had attended) the engineer themselves struggled to get the back case off of the laptop and had ended up snapping the cover. As this was done by the engineer we were shipped a new rear case free of charge, but if we had repaired it ourselves and made the same mistake, we'd be looking to have to pay for a new rear case. This is why we will not disassemble any Lenovo laptop ourselves in future."
else	Improve customer/technical support line, hold time.
else	The person I spoke with was friendly, but misdiagnosed the problem and sent a tech with parts. I had to wait 2 days only to find out the hardware was not the problem. I wound up solving the problem myself. It was a software update that fixed it.
else	complete resolution
else	Significant improvements in your tracking and shipping process.
else	Item returned saying no problem found. On return I turned item on and 2 mins later it turned itself off.
else	Maintain Stock for spare parts.
else	Lenovo submitted incorrect shipping information, missing my apartment unit. The tech was A+ amazing, but the delivery of parts was unreliable. The tech got lucky and flagged down the delivery person after they failed to find the address.
else	Change the return policy for products under warranty
else	Offer better updates on what is actually happening. My device went on and off of 'Hold' for a month as parts were swapped out. It was very frustrating receiving such little feedback and having to wait over a week each time the wrong part was ordered.
else	If there's a way to make sure the part is not defective, this would be great
else	turn around time could be faster.  I have users without their laptop waiting.
else	They said I will get replacement by one week. It's almost 3 weeks and Motorola service centre doesn't ever bother to call and update the status. Even after paying advance I don't see any progress. Team is so hopeless. The attitude they show I was feeling it was my biggest mistake to buy Motorola product.
else	Come on time. Have appropriate security credemtials for onsite work. Do NOT make rookie mistakes such as forgetting to save Bitkeeper keys.
else	Next time before rolling out an Android update to the public make sure that all features of the tablets are functioning properly. In addition, when you sent back a product that has been repaired, please include a letter detailing what has been repaired and what are the requirements for it to function correctly - in my case was that my tablet was downgraded to Android 6.00 in order to function, however no one let me know that this is the case. When the tablet updated its Android version to 7.1.1 automatically the issue (rear camera cannot lock focus) reappeared.
else	I'm a 30 plus ibm  / ibm think pad buyer I recamended Lenovo for years then I got this one.... had now for 14 months... realy never got to use muce due to it slow n locks up... less after repair but still locks up....we bought 3 at same time 2 went back and this I keped  sad... I spoke so highly of the brand.....
else	Listen to your customers and stop generic approach to resolution
else	More experience engineer with proper tools and better knowledge
else	It seemed that the replacement parts (sys-boards) we're damaged and restocked into IBM repair tech surplusTThis is the second time in a year that we've had to have 2-3 attempts to repair system boards on 2 different models A P50 and This P51after strike 3 you want us the customer to depot the machine. Leaving us short a machine waiting for a week or more.Thankfully we were able to resolve the last issues due to OS version RHEL 7.5  which you have no support on.
else	Having replacement parts more available.
else	Maybe send a email to update status
else	every thing was OK, with the exception that there was a misinterpretation of which part was actually defect.
else	Lenovo  support team  and part deliverer is very bad
else	make better parts...I know it's a stretch.list the phone number to call, our tec center had it, not me. I had the problem and needed to have direct access.text updates on parts status, I had to reach out and connect with you instead of being made aware of status.
else	I will like to receive a credit for the defective laptop, in order to purchase a better one from Lenovo and pay the difference.
else	Customer service shipped the wrong replacement part the first time even though I was very specific about the problem. So I had to make two 1/2 day trips to the service facility. Repair was completed on second trip and my laptop is fixed.
else	provide the new parts . increase your service & engineers,
else	return my computer, return phone calls when placed, have english speaking representatives who also UNDERSTAND verbage. Horrible experience will never buy another product from your company
else	I had to return the original replacement device which had some problems.
else	Everything needs to improve, Mainly service partner and Technical support person asking for so many pictures and videos.
else	Keep customers better informed with ETAs of back order parts
else	I got no feedback from the technician so i don't know what the verdict was with the laptop
else	send a techician on time
else	If the part is available sooner
else	Expected feedback from service support. It's only issue is with the product itself. 2 service support within a year is not good.  Also, for second support, the technician left without further checking the serial number of the mother board takes place or not, ending up a third visit was taken place.
else	1. The problem was not fixed on the phone... 2. There was no resolution but to restore the machine to factory3. There was no guidance on attempting to restore the machine to a restore point
else	I'm waiting almost a month for a replacement device.
else	Ideally a speedier turnaround, worked from home for several days awaiting for a technician but kept being told the part was unavailable. Admittedly this might be the fault of our internal IT dept.
else	Make sure the service center talks to the field techs to ensure all necessary parts are available when the technician arrives.
else	Make the online tracking more accurate as this didn't tell me how it was progressing I called.
else	less complicated telephone access
else	Take more time to understand the issue, and have a more technically capable person be able to assess the root cause and actually solve the issue.
else	Replacement parts (screen) were broken or don't fit.
else	the broken part was replaced but not tested and it still does not work
else	fix awaiting time
else	The machine did not work properly upon return
else	To make calls queries more user friendly and easier to understand.
else	There are no updates for an long time
Agent	Get better agents. He was rude never really spoke. Told me he would be working in silence. Return call on one phone never came through and the other phone took over an hour for a 10 minute wait
else	Tale ownership and respond quicker - check the log on thwe account plus multipler attemtps on DM Twitter
else	A lot. Didn't receive AC Adapter back. Was not told to respond to email, then got sent that due to no response they are sending it back. Give my A.C. Adapter back
else	It has been returned 4 times now. Same defect remains.
else	I called Lenovo and was given the wrong information the first time - was told parts would be shipped to me and a technician would call to schedule repair.  I had to call back to find out my laptop had to be sent in for repair.  Then, as it eventually turned out, the main damage was not covered by my warranty so the effort of sending in my laptop for repair was not worth it.  It would have been good to know upfront that screen and keyboard damage were not covered by my warranty.
else	Give me updates on timescales for a fix and delivery of my laptop
else	You can freaking help me. I called because my brand new computer had crashed and you did NOTHING.  I was told that I had to PAY to send a computer to you that was had crashed due to hardware failure. Complete and total crap! What a waste of my time. I loved Lenovo and recommended it to my friends, family and clients but I will stop.
Agent	Have knowleable agents who can trouble shoot issues and understand English better
else	Need to study how to installing and open out the laptop before came
else	Provide a product that does not have issues every time an update to the operating system takes place. The  Lenovo was still under warranty for hardware but was not covered for operating system yet the Lenovo couldnt handle the update without loosing functionality. Lenovo expected me to pay for a problem that was due to their equipment failure.
else	atleast acknowledge the issue and accept it is a faulty equipment
else	Screen did not function, was told non warranty unit failed while in docking station.
else	My issue has not been resolved, my parts have been on back order for almost a week, and I can't use my computer. Lenovo could expedite the repair of my computer and recognize the major inconvenience it has caused.
else	Finish resolving the unresolved technical issue.
else	On-site service representative broke camera while replacing a screen. When I discovered that the camera was broken they seem to have not informed the technical team to order a new camera. I had to again log a complaint on my own. I got very delayed and cold response. I was never told about how much time it will take to fix the problem whenever I asked.
else	It was hard to see the progress of my return , also i still need to call to get microsoft word back on my computer . I bought the forever plan and It keeps telling me I need to renew by subscribtoon to microsoft word .
else	Please receive call on timely.
else	e-mail status updates on the return of my computer.  As of now I send computer to Lenovo and receive no feedback like: received, under investigation, being reviewed, etc...
else	Better communication on how long it will take to get necessary replacement parts in
else	We had to call multiple times to get someone to come and fix the issue. But once the service engineer came to our house to fix the issue. He did a good job and fixed the problem. We have a problem with the phone support. It is a hit or miss.
else	Don't send emails saying part on back order when the part actually shipped.
else	1) Better English speaking technicians 2) More polite technicians3) More reasonable timelines - not a 2 hour window in the middle of someone's work day - your customers are often professionals - who can't afford to sit around waiting for a technician for 2 hours 4) More accessible customer service representatives - i still cannot get in touch with a customer service manager
else	Make sure the parts needed for the service are properly shipped to the technician prior to scheduling a visit.
else	wrong part was shipped
else	Value the customer and treat them as people that purchased your product because they wanted it, and return it with haste if it's sent to you.
else	to update their in dos base laptop and desktop
else	Send your tech's the correct part
else	Because every dept that I was transferred to told me the part was not their issue
else	My laptop was sent in for repair twice and both times the problem was not resolved.  On the third call I spent an hour being asked to follow instructions in an attempt to repair remotely.  This was a waste of time as the issue could not be resolved and I was told it would need to go in for a third time.   I was to wait 2 days for pick up because the item was into the 2nd year of it's warranty period.   I don't understand why it was given low priority when we had already been inconvenienced by 3 breakdowns.
else	Waiting over four weeks for a part is unacceptable
else	Make phone access  for assistance with specific products easier.  I called several numbers to find the terrific service that I finally received.  It should be as easy as it is getting someone in  sales.
else	The incorrect part was shipped to your technician.  He was somehow able to address the issue despite that.  So super kudos to the technician.
else	Better feedback, when site visits are involved.
else	It took 3 days and 4 phone calls to initiate the return.
else	I had to deal with HP in the same week and unfortunately they came out a lot better. It was a much different experience.
else	I have reached care centre for power adaptor issue. But they asked me for  take backup and factory reset.when I asked for adaptor issue why should I format my phone.then there is answer for this. When they asked technical team there is no format required.its observed that there is no communication between receiptent and technical team. It's wasted my 2 hrs for backup.
else	After update of Marshamell to nougat  Moto M the games more than 250mb are  unable to installed  and security was not procted
else	Lenovo not supports 3rd party KVM swithes
else	customer did not have password for the hard rive before taking the device apart
else	Still waiting for service / warranty regarding ticket.
else	The help desk phone was poor quality and very hard to hear.
else	to hard to get technical help
else	provide support telephone numbers and/or email addresses; provide support staff who can speak clearly without background noise
else	Redo the entire Customer Service Department and hire better third party repair vendors
else	Initial replacement part was defective, so a second replacement part needed to be ordered. Took and extra day for a total of three business days.
else	I think the issue is not well understood and I believe it's some kind of update that is causing the issue if the new equipment isn't faulty itself.
else	Better communication in the form of regular status updates would be nice, but overall satisfied with the results of my service.
else	Replacement of tablet if the repair work takes longer than two weeks.  We sent four tablets, that were only 1 month old, in for service, and had to purchase four replacements to use because the warranted tablets were taking too long for completion/return.
else	Perhaps Lenovo could listen to what the issue is and send the needed part.
else	I had to sit on the phone for 3+ hours and then never received a call back
else	The support call should not have been required.  Lenovo had the incorrect sales date in their system.
else	No one came
else	I had to ring twice. Person A hadn't followed through and person C never contacted me. This was AFTER I had sent email to person B
else	A little more warning about what time the service person would be coming would be appreciated (they called me and came about twenty minutes later).
else	Real-time updates
else	send me an update what the problem was with the device
else	the phone stopped working and I needed it fixed or replaced the process was fast and easy at no cost to me which I loved. thank you motorola!
else	Allow for escalation when vanilla remediation steps are insufficient (reboot, re-install drivers, update, etc)
else	it is mandatory to make available the spare parts of lenovo products whether  in warranty or out warranty. there requires many spares like display, stripe, harddisk combo cable, motherboard for Lenovo Think centre M70z 7597A27 machines through out maharashtra.
else	There are too many prompts which can make it confusing. Also when I got someone, even though I selected the proper option, they said I needed to be transferred and when I got someone else they said I was in the wrong department and needed to go back. This caused me to be on the phone way too long almost an hour to get someone again.  Thus this caused me to give a low survey score.
else	The phone tree to get to a support staff person was VERY confusing.  I finally just hit whatever # I could remember was close enough to my laptop Yoga 720 and at least the support person could help me immediately.  I wasn't transferred to someone else and Mason was just FABULOUS!!!
else	More service centre which are easily accessable with skill man power & Hand Pick-up facility with acknowledgement may be provided.
else	waiting for warranty updates, spare not available and os updates.
else	Send an e-mail when part has been shipped
else	my laptop has scratches when I received it back from the service centre and no action was taken even when notified
else	waiting for part, changing address on case pushed the service dates back.
else	Need better instructions when the product is returned.  After the product was returned I still had to call in, wait 45 minutes for a technician and then go through a 30-45 minute routine to get the computer running.
else	I had a terrible experience calling Lenovo for a computer that experienced fan failure on first startup. I called customer service who transferred me to Think Tech support. Think Tech support then transferred me to sales. Sales then transferred me to Parts Replacement. Parts Replacement then transferred me back to sales. Sales then told me I needed to speak with Encompass and run through some troubleshooting with tech support before being given a replacement. I wasn't at the computer so I called back a few days later and was told no troubleshooting was necessary as the computer was less than 30 days old. Customer service was able to create a case for me on this second day. Poor experience overall.
else	More transparency into the timeline delivery of spare parts related to service calls.
else	As I said on the first question, read the tickets that are submitted and send the right part.
else	Both failures of this machine, as I understood from technical support were due to a Lenovo bios update that was more than the motherboard could handle in the first instance and because the bios update was not compatible with my machine in the second instance. What am I to do about future Lenovo updates bios or anything? I have little faith if I attempt anything Lenovo recommends that it will be successful.
else	I had purchased a Lenovo Y520-15IKBN 80WK00WQMJ SN# :IS80WK00WQMJPF0V30RZ from you store in Thunder Match Technology Lot L2-61C, Second Floor, IOI City Mall, Putrajaya on 13 March 2018. After buying the laptop I had gone through a lot of problem with the laptop.First of all, after buying the laptop I cannot update the windows and it was very slow. The total utilization of all physical drives (hard disk) percentage was always 100. It wont go down a single percent which made the laptop to lag and unable to process smoothly. I called the Lenovo service center 1800-818-478 and made a report. The lenovo center technician created a case number 8010890812. Then he ask me to update the system using lenovo vantage. The lenovo vantage program cannot run and process which made me to reset the whole laptop. Even after that the problem was not solved. I have made report sending few email to lenserv@lenovo.com on march 16 & march 22. The technician guided me via phone to off the windows search and superfetch in services.msc. After few failure attempts Lenovo send me a onsite engineer on March 21 changing the hard disk, March 27 changing the motherboard of the laptop. In the end nothing changed the laptop was having the same problem. On 29 March on site engineer Mr.Nizam took the laptop to his place for troubleshoot the problems.Even not once I used my laptop because of this problem, and its going to be 3 weeks since I bought this. I am tired of having this problem again and again. Please do take this issue seriously and resolve it for me as soon as possible. I want to request a refund/exchange of the product. If no further actions are taken by your team to resolve my issue, I will have to file a complaint against Lenovo. This is because I purchased the product in an authorized retail store of Lenovo itself. I will be awaiting your response on this matter.Regards,Arulbagesan A/L Kalaiselvan
else	Keep me more informed on the repair status; I had no word until the computer was being shipped back.  Then once it was returned, the charging cable was not returned.
else	Train your customer service reps to more friendly and professional
else	There was no follow up call from the call center as they promised to call back. Phone calls I made takes 45 minutes wait to get a live person on line, that's any time of the day and night, false advertising on your Web site regarding 24/7 costumer service I tried calling  numerous times to prove a point and got connected 4 times. Yes it's cheaper to outsource your call center but since they got all my information and records on hand it's should be an easy process to get tech center to acquire all info. There is a big problem on both part they are not in sync, quite embarasing on your part since your on a computer business and have all the technology and program to utilize. My suggestion is to stream line your process, or just get rid of your call center since they can't do their job right.
else	My Android was not returned in a safe/break proof manner.
else	Nobody came at location.
else	One techmician rang me. I returned his call but never heard back. All good though Alan is a great technician.
else	have parts in local stock
else	Give Techs several possible parts instaed of one. Then have to order another, then another.... Too much time wasted
else	Be proactive and give status updates, especially when there are delays. Stock repair parts so I don't have to wait weeks (or in this case, months) for a repair part to come from China,.
else	please advise if updates are to be installed before they are installed
else	"This unit arrived at depot on January 8 and didn't ship out until January 19. The only message was ""released from hold"" on Jan 10. I asked for feedback twice on this unit and never received any update. I called customer support and asked them to have the depot call me with an update and never received one. If the unit was waiting for parts then why couldn't I be informed of this? This student was without a computer for nearly 3 weeks for a cracked LCD. That's not acceptable."
else	parts were shipped and sat waiting for pickup for 2 days.  It took 3 days to get our Next Business Day contract repair completed.
else	They are not solving my issue up till today, was being push in between the reseller and call centre.
else	Faster parts shipments
else	Have parts in house
else	Returned a brand new laptop on advice  Lenovo and still l waiting for a refund
else	There was an update which failed. Check updates to ensure they work . Check computers so they do not require an update.
else	The Yoga book I purchased has never work since I received it.  Why was the non-functional one just exchanged with one that worked.  It has been over 2 months and many hours trying to get a device that works.
else	Need to communicate professionaly and on site engineer should respect the site and company.
else	Explain what was wrong with product and how.to.prevent it from reoccurring.
else	took a lot of time to get part shipped i got my laptop back after 27 days
else	Please deliver the required parts in a quicker way.
else	Improve your part delivery services.
else	Provide tracking number for the empty box that is used to send equipment for repair (had to wait more than 3 weeks and call for status a couple of times)
else	ensure spare parts are buffer for repair, waiting for replacement part is most of the case
else	I am still experiencing hardware problems, I purchased an on-site repair warranty and no one has called me tos schedule the repair.
else	update your customer service and send products that work.
else	better motherboard for sure, not getting spoiled in 15 months... and faster repair time...
else	No feedback. All okay
Agent	It took 3 weeks to replace the mechanism that holds the pen on my BRAND NEW THINKPAD.  I had to keep reminding Lenovo that it still wasn't fixed and supposedly the incorrect part was ordered multiple times.  I pay for next-day onsite service so this is unacceptable. Fortunately for Lenovo, this is my 4th Thinkpad (which I love the product) and my previous experiences with onside next day have been excellent. I hope this recent experience was a fluke.
else	waiting for other parts. initial parts provided is wrong
else	Provide a drop off location for return warranty product.
else	The problem reoccurred the next day after service.
Agent	improve on customer service skills and try to follow up with customer needs promptly
else	More explanation regarding how and what is needed to ship the unit with. The check list is a bit ambiguous with regard to what if anything is required with shipping to the repair center. Also, a quick sheet about how to package the unit would be helpful. I only found the instruction video after I shipped the unit. I sent my computer in with my original box/packaging to insure protection. Of course the original packaging box did not return with my computer. It's not a problem because it is not needed but I would not have used it if the packaging instructions had been included in the packaging instructions paper. The web site did not update my information as to the timing of my repair. My repair unit was returned in a timely manner with no complaint. However, it arrived as a surprise as I was not update as to the status of my repair and/or delivery.
else	Better communication while the parts are on back order would be nice.
else	I had the tech call and say he was coming out once he got the part, but he never showed. I never heard anything after that and twice escalated it again with no response. My coworker opened another ticket on  this and it got resolved within  a couple of days. I have never experienced such poor service from Lenovo support. They have always been great before this.
else	Explain better the turn on process once computer is returned
else	Make it easier to get to the right contact page on the site if you need repair/support
else	I am still awaiting delivery of my recovery media I have not got it yet they promised me at a certain date and it still has not arrived
Agent	better follow up on customer request
else	Replace with new laptop for high end high corporate laptops rather than tear the whole thing apart and replace the system board. The SSD is the only thing that should be salvged.Better root cause analysis by working with Cisco. This was cased by cisco s/w which is known to brick laptops!
else	Call the customer with updates as to when tech support will go onsite.
else	I feel I could not have received a better response to my problem.
else	The laptop was returned with a new problem.  The CPU fan sounds like it is going to fail anytime now.  It did not have that problem before.
else	Be a little faster at providing parts to your technicians.
else	Shorter wait time.  Service was ecxellent
else	Test devices before returning them. If you send me a broken device, don't make me send it in again and again. Replace it.
else	Better QC cos when product was recieved it was showing symptoms of failure and was complicated with numourous updates from microsoft.
else	Faster initial response and communciate date/time for repair within the timescales provided. An engineer only called 20 mins before arriving with no prior notice. This was also outside of the provided response time.
else	Not given call to third party engg, Handle with dirctly,
else	Give actual updates and not vague statuses of events in the portal. Even in the laptop box I received when I got it back, there was a paper that said it was fixed but no notes of what was wrong or replaced. Even though I had the shipping address on the profile, they lacked putting the suite number so a depot laptop took 1 week longer to receive due to fed ex not able to deliver without the suite number.
else	Offer me better resolution when my computer hasn't been fixed and now I can use it when it's only 6 months old
else	Took a bit long to receive the part
else	No problem with the Service Desk, but it's been two weeks we are experiencing an issue for serveral users with T480s and USB-C dock and manager was supposed to call but never called STILL.
else	should come on time
else	Provide shipping to receive the devices.
else	Stop putting people off telling them at every call they will need to wait 24 to 48 hours to hear something
else	The Yoga book that I am attempting to make my primary email/ document/ web browsing platform does not support external data transfer well (except wifi). It would have been nice if this aspect had been provided for in the design of the product through a USB c connector.
else	Provide some instruction or communication after ticket is created - the only notice I had that the laptop would need to be shipped was when the return box arrived.
else	Per instruction from Lenovo, I called local depot to have the party installed.  They said they do not install parts provided by customer, and that the laptop would have to be left for 3 days--I was told by Lenovo to expect walk-in service.
else	Repair the unit in the short amount of time.
else	1) Have parts in warehouse to service next day delivery support, meeting what I paid to have for hardware support. You STOPPED having this when China switched to JIT parts supply -- which it has NOT delivered on.
else	Regular updates
else	stock parts local
else	stand behind their product when it malfunctions my problem is still not resolved so I'm still waiting for acceptable resolution to my new problem with the screen blacking out when i pick the laptop up to simply place it on my table.
Agent	more explaining about what the service agent is doing. Please do not assume your caller is tech savvy
else	We have had extensive delays in replacement parts for this laptop twice now. The service technician has been excellent, but the parts delivery/availability is sub-standard.
else	Find out why it breaks down every 2 to 3 months. Have techs actually return a call. They almost never do.  Even when escalated it takes almost a week just for a phone call.
else	I didn't know support was finished; did not receive any notification.
else	The amount of occasions in which there is a wait for parts. Technicians should be able to get warranty parts relatively quick or just announce a recall because there are too many occasions when this is announced.
else	The same error happened one day after the call I made. It has not been able to turn on since, even with the steps given to me over the phone
else	The parts are almost never available for next day service.  It some times takes days for the technician to receive the parts.  I use this warranty so my mostly remote sales staff can get back up and running quickly without having a loaner laptop sent out.  If the parts are not readily available it defeats the purpose.
else	Stop releasing BIOS updates that are poorly tested.  This is the 4th such occurrence in four years.  On two different high-end workstations.  All required motherboard replacement and great inconvenience and expense to us both.  Test more and save money.
else	Would like to connect with the technical team a little faster.
else	Please suppy parts faster if possible
else	Not sure how this happened but every single time i called in and updated the address information there was another error every day. I have never had such terrible service from any support company before. This was the worst experience I've encountered with support. Ive never had such a failure of communication with so many different support agents. It reflects poorly on your company when i reach 4 different technicians accross 5 days and have to call in 7 times for about an hour a piece to still get the information wrong with the address and the case. If i had not called and convinced the dispatched repair technician to go to the new address personally it would have taken 8 days for a next day repair, this is a massive failure on your part.
else	Provide clearer labeling and installation instructions with your Windows 7 recovery media.
else	Better coordination between parts delivery and onsite visits.
else	You could provide pre-paid postage for faster transport of the laptop to the repair facility. You could also provide means of getting us a box and packing material for sending the laptop back. E.g. contract with FedEx for a box and packing.
else	Fix minor issues immediately and return the equipment, it saves a lot of time for the customers
else	Use common sense when evaluating calls. Don't mislead customers in an attempt to get them to pay software support.
else	Use better LCD Screen for professional laptop. Monitor screens are sucks on current models like ThinkPad P50, P51, P70, P71 and so on.
else	While I ended up receiving a new device that works, it took two attempts (first replacement was broken in the same way as my original device) and a fair amount of funds and time on my part (needed to ship with my own expenses to and from USA/Canada). I had to jump through hoops, with multiple people, multiple times, to get somebody that would go off-script to find a solution with me. I have purchased over 10 Motorola devices, and referred the phones to multiple buyers. I am not sure if I would stay with Motorola in the future.
else	"The time-lag from receiving the parts (and being told a technician would be there the next day) to a technician actually contacting me to fit the parts was too long. It took about a week after I'd previously been told it would be done ""tomorrow""."
else	allow to update the issue ticket by the customer, i. e. to add further details
else	Waiting on getting a part. Had done several requests to get the technicianThe technician should call to give a follow up on what is happeningIt is been almost a month, still waiting on the repair to be completed
else	The updates on my warranty status not shared on time. I was initiating the call each time to get the updates. So it would be helpful if you can improve the communication on the status of the job request. Other than that it was good experience. I got the mobile back in a day after the warranty update. (warranty update took 7 days which includes rejection in 1st time because of the poor bill clarity)
else	faster warranty update and better services related to the warranty of the product.Better understanding of the issue by the tele representative was there but still it took too much time coz of warranty updation issue
else	The vendor said they would return the replaced hard drive and never put it in the box.
else	A quicker response to the issue and clearer instruction on how to fix the problem
else	no support on the phone, and could not understand support sent by email. notebooks hard drive in full and it is a piece of crap.  I WANT MY MONEY BACK
else	Lenovo cannot actually return emails, answer the phone or respond back to Messenger requests.  We received this device and IT IS NOT OURS.  Immediately, we emailed Lenovo to inform them of this SNAFU but did not receive a response so another email attempt was made without response.  We called Lenovo and hung up after waiting over 15 minutes for a rep (I had to get back to work).  Lastly, I tried using the Messenger app to reach out to Lenovo.  Someone responded to me on Monday and requested info, I responded back and then was asked for additional information to which I responded back with on Monday night.  The last message I sent was never even opened and it is now Wednesday.  Not only does sending someone else's device to us show a total lack of competence but it is expounded upon by the fact that we cannot seem to get assistance in getting it back to the correct person!!!!  I surely hope someone actually reads this review and finds it in them to actually contact us about this matter.
else	Not dent my laptop and return it in a more timely manner.
else	SYSNET GLOBAL the official vendor who was taking my call to resolve the issue was very bad at service.
else	I have been waiting 4 weeks for an engineer to arrive, part has been shipped 3 different times now.
else	Waiting on call from 3rd Tech with new parts.  30 days still unresolved.
else	speed up part and engineer getting to site. This call took 5 business days
else	wrong parts have been delivered twice. Now the thrid delivery. No tecnician showed up yet so my is still not fixed nor do i know if the right parts have been deliverd yet.
else	Better timings for service professionals. I leave home at 10 am and come back after 9.30 pm on a weekday. Can't expect me to be better available on weekdays, so either provide late hour service or service on weekends.
else	I had a complete lack of communication from the Lenovo service center, with Lenovo representatives forgetting to order a replacement part for our laptop or book an engineer. Very dissapointed with the service serviced. Communication with the engineer attended the site was fine.
else	The worst service ever I've received from any service centre . The problem was barely solved , I had to visit the service centre twice in 5 days , keeping my patience I went again n cooperated well. Then after when I came back home the same problem still persists , my charger was working perfectly fine bt the fellow lady sitting at the service station denied the fact n told me get a new one . The service centre even removed a part from my phone which further led to a problem . This was by far my worst experience . Will never buy a Motorola mobile phone in future and will tell others the same .
else	Laptop has been returned with the same problem
else	Treat every special case less generically. Basic solutions are easy enough to find online. Support should provide advanced help.
else	Respond in a timely manner, use an alternate form of communication if one does not seem to work, send a tech with the right parts. It is really that simple.
else	The machine had a different processor when I received it back.
else	Serial No-PF0VVBHJ SO No-7009064434 With due respect,  I claimed my ADP warranty ,which on online diagnosis had registered 8 parts replacement. But after a few days , an engineer visited on the site for offline diagnosis and he reported 7 parts replacement claiming that the D part will be fitted after replacing the C part. So no need to change the D part. But when the engineer visited on site for replacement of the parts on 12th of December, the D part was not fitting with the C part . On claiming for a revisit, the engineer came very late and that too on 31st of december after 20 days .   And in the onsite report of revisit , It is mentioned that Harikesh sir will deal with the matter and certain screenshots & photos were shared with the revisited engineer on his whatsapp as directed by him.  But no one replied to me since then. Its mere rubbish that this typical nonsense quality of service is provided by LENOVO where the onsite engineer gives assurance that my problem will be resolved and then no one even contacts me till I make a call from my side. The case is still not closed. Please give me the updates as soon as possible because my warranty is going to end by 26th of january,2019 . The name of the engineer with whom the snaps are shared is PABITRO MOHANTY. And the service report of onsite engineer for diagnosis as well as the revisit case is attached. Also the online diagnosis conducted earlier(where D part was mentioned for replacement but then denied by the engineer who came for offline diagnosis ) snapshot is attached & the laptop snaps are also attached. Please handle the case as quickly as possible. FEEDBACK: very bad service.
else	Sir, I bought Moro x4 thinking that (typically) Motorola is known for giving updates as Earlines as possible, but sorry to say no updates at all . In coming days android p would be launched and I have not got update for android 8.01 ! Moreover my security patch is of December 2017. Dont know why like this, is this because of Lenovo!   thank you and I am also suffering from heating issues and easy battery loss.plz do reply.,thank you
else	The first request resulted in some (but not even the most important) parts being sent to our home, along with a box to send the computer out to the depot. We have on-site service, so the box should never have been sent, and the most likely cause of the problem was the video cable, but only the display and screen bezel were sent. Once the video cable and technician were dispatched, things went very well. But the video cable and on-site technician should have been dispatched from the initial request.
else	Wrong part supplied and assumed tech was organising the correct part
else	My laptop isn't even starting now.within two weeks of service.i came to USA.i don't know what to do now.
else	improve wait times. quite a few options to go through and some where repeated
else	Laptop returned, but without Windows installed
else	I don't remember service call on that date.
else	Im still waiting
else	return phone calls, follow up on tickets
else	Faster fixing times, and better service on the phone
else	provide parts with a nbd replacement
else	The deposit to get the new phone first has still not been returned to my account.
else	Keep more spare parts in supply locally
else	Sending the parts to the engineers when they need them and telling customers when they will come. The online service/system could be more user friendly.
else	Don't leave me hanging for a month when I request updates/escalate everyday... Do you guys even have management?
else	You sent parts to the wrong location. My 3 day service call turned into a 2 week ordeal. You closed out my initial service ticket with zero communication. The technician was professional.
else	Still waiting on a return from depot
else	Do what the warranty promised and fix my laptop faster than two months!
else	I m waiting for my display to be changed it was in warranty
else	build better parts
else	Ensure you have the correct replacement part first time
else	didn't receive the back of original phone with the original warranty phone returned to me and had difficulty getting replacement phone to recognize the sim card#. However, I just received the original phone back cover yesterday and also be advised that Verizon assisted me in getting the phone to recognize the sim card after I had spend way to much time on line without success with your ladies to get the sim card to be read on the phone without success.
else	Have parts on hand.  Delayed resolution because part was not available.
else	More timely resolution, and if not, definitely better communication about it.
Agent	The accents was difficult to understand during part of the conversation and we did not want to be rude during the conversation, however being able to speak with someone who speaks clear English would be helpful.
else	Have not return my tablet
else	Provide an update and notification of the resolution. I had no idea when the notebook had been repaired it was only when my daughter came home with it.
else	Initial pickup from a residential location was unsatisfactory: courier did not collect on the designated day and no communication received.  Pickup on the next day required 2 phone calls to resolve.  Having the option to drop off at a courier depot would have saved much inconvenience.
else	I was informed of battery replacement but no information received for new battery replaement.
else	I received email notifications with status updates after the fact.  For example, I got word that the laptop had arrived at Lenovo well after the repaired unit was returned to me.  More timely status updates are the only area of improvement.  Everything else was great.
else	Pickup and return services should be improved
else	Make the background noise quieter while communicating with your service rep. There needs to be a filter added to mask toe sound coming through the MIC.
else	Please have a better customer service system so those who track the stays online can reach folks to get the status. After being on hold for 45 minutes two times, and being transferred twice, no one could give a proper answer.
else	bad motherboard sent as the first replacment
else	Still awaiting replacement item
else	Faster response and action?
else	I did not receive any email or call informing me that my laptop was ready for collection. Unsurprisingly, I received 3 emails from Lenovo for this survey.
else	Sometimes my service number did not show up when checking repair status.
else	Improve all aspects of Pro Support, call center, availability of spare parts very poor, communication standardized without any service feeling and totally anonymous. In case of lost line, no call back......etc.
else	Still waiting for Mgr to call back
else	Show some punctuality & change your inexperienced engineers. They are not at all good. Specially in Bhubaneswar & Balasore.Serial No-PF0VVBHJSO No-7009064434With due respect, I claimed my ADP warranty ,which on online diagnosis had registered 8 parts replacement. But after a few days , an engineer visited on the site for offline diagnosis and he reported 7 parts replacement claiming that the D part will be fitted after replacing the C part. So no need to change the D part.But when the engineer visited on site for replacement of the parts on 12th of December, the D part was not fitting with the C part .

else	Please send the correct number and type of parts needed.
else	Speed it up and more communication as to when it is returned.
else	Tell me in writing how I can stop notifications coming in daily (or more) that ask me to 'tap my computer with my phone'
else	Very long wait till I reached a representative.
else	Better customer service, call back your customers when requested.
else	kindly arrange the parts asap
else	"I believe that the technician should have more parts on hand. For instance, he discovered that one of the batteries was ""bloated"" when he opened the unit to replaced the system board. Now I have had to order one and I will replaced it myself."
else	Have better communication, respond to emails in a timely manner, stock parts closer in the north east, set clearer expectations when replacement hardware will arrive
else	laptop returned to me with a broken bezel when it was not  sent that way
else	Warranty is for next day service, but it took nearly a week to get the PC repaired.  Had to wait on replacemen parts.
else	Please resolve all our complains on time
else	Don't forget to return the power supply that I shipped you. Or change the instructions to no longer recommend mailing in the power supply. Fortunately, after I informed Lenovo about the missing power supply, they responded quickly by sending me a replacement.
else	Better support for technical faults including model specific problem with lenovo's hardware with windows 10
else	Brand new one was repaired 3 times now,,,advertisement is bigger but quality is poor.
else	make sure that BITLOCKER is not on when you return the machine to a person if it was not on it when you recieved it.
else	Get someone that is more knowledgeable with how to do the work that they're required to do instead of contractors
else	To deliver the part at the earliest
else	1. near the end of the first year in use, my laptop's keyboard became unusable. after a looooong time on customer support via mobile phone, and after 2 weeks of waiting time, the technicial finally came, and  installed a new keyboard.2. near the end of the second year in use, my laptop's keybaord became unuable AGAIN, with very similar problems. This time, i issued an online form for help and the replacement part arrived the next 3 businesses days. I swapt the keyboard in myself. everything is ok.3. about THREE WHOLE WEEKS LATER, the technician decides to call me, asking if i am at home to come by and fix the problme for me. no need. he just took the old part back! if lenovo cannot support next business day on-site warranty, then specify it in your warranty conditions so that customers know whether by buying a lenovo machine, they will get stack with even the tiniest problem for a month before they can use their laptop again! at least be decent if you do not afford to widen, and enhance your customer services lenovo! at least decency! plus, it would be great to create a program where unsatisfied customers can turn their laptops in and be able to buy new ones at reduced prices!
else	Fix the Canadian web site to accept serial numbers of newly purchased machines from the U.S.Make contacting Lonovo easy as opposed to difficult. General phone number. Phone number or electronic contact for the solution to the obvious identified problem that shows up in red on the site.Make finding a user manual easy on the Canadian site.
else	Allow to bring more parts for the On Site Engineer instead of waiting for parts.
else	I had to visit the service center twice for the same complaint,on my first visit they reset my phone but the problem was not rectified.It was an eyewash.The problem was  cracked sound from ear speaker( receiver) during calls.on the very first visit they didnot replaced the ear speaker only reseted the phone .On my next visit after 2-3 days i had to tell them to replace the reciever.pathetic i had to wait for 2hours.then an extra hour for them to reset the phone.This time they replaced the defective speaker(ear reciever). That too on my second visit.Service center- hcl touch shop no 155 sector-3 rohini aggarwal city plaza manglam plaza near m2k rohini.Pathetic experience.
else	take care of returns in a timely manor
else	Send a box to return the item
else	The problem with the delay in service is because the parts is not available in Canada.  Levono should constantly check the parts stock level to ensure the prompt service.
else	Be more willing to help with shipping labels, etc.
else	This first employee did not set anything up for a laptop return.
else	Answer the phone and not hang up when i call for support, give an accurate time estimate, keep the customer updated when things are not within the usual parameters
else	The return time was too long
else	Make your laptops less v ulnerable Microsofts update failures
else	You can improve the customer care as the users are not always technical so better the issue should checked while visiting as its difficult to resolve it on phone due some technicalicity.
else	Get parts in faster
else	A better job of stocking parts or expediting delivery for an out of stock item.
else	The materials provided to return the computer tp you were not suffecient.  The computer was damaged in supping back to you. Same type of material was used to return the computer to me.
else	Keep customer informed and updated of support issue
else	faster  time of parts delovery
else	Problem with return policy
else	Provide techs with spare parts sufficient to cover all possible problem solutions.  This will ensure that the problem can be solved in one support visit.  It took 3 to solve my problem.
else	Still waiting on field tech to call & schedule service
else	More information in email updates
else	I am receiving a survey and have not been delivered a part yet. On average (9/10 times) items are on back order. This severally causes disruptions to our business. Please correct the back order issue.
else	fix the problem - since the last Windows update, my on screen message for cap locks on or off does not show up.
else	decrease waiting time.
else	faster/effective repair or replacement of defective equipment
else	yes but the original parts spoil before even a year
else	I have twice contacted support regarding my warranty (according to lenovo starting in June, but I purchased it at the end of November), sent in my receipts (to the email given me) and NOTHING HAS CHANGED. YOU HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING AND THIS IS A RIP OFF
else	Lenovo should not install incompatible drivers in the first place or have them as recommended updates and the first consultant got me to do such things as battery reset which was obviously not going to solve the problem given the symptoms I described but I had to waste time doing it.
else	train your staff on how to deal with multiple inquiries (from schools or businesses with multiple devices) I could not understand the woman on the phone, very broken english
else	Better tech support , parts are always on back order, Lanovo can not replace more than one part at a time, next day means 3 days, you have the worse support in the industry .
else	Do not install faulty parts
else	Fix items faster and give customers an accurate time frame when they should expect their product to be returned
else	Better training of the tech that process the returns.
else	Tech did not coordinate with the user and came when she wasn't there.
else	Lenovo dont have quality, either in their product, spare, support service, problem resolution chain, anything.... it might be my personal experience but Lenovo is a failure at each component.. It had a brand and trust of professionals but now it had gone to its lowest... Im assured sooner we will see lenovo fading from the market....
else	"I had a battery failure on a Phone that I had recently received as a design refresh from Motorola. I had not had the phone for even a year and yet I was expected to pay out of pocket for a replacement device to be overnighted to me. I was without a Phone from the time the device failed, a device that had already been paid for! There is no reason that I would have to pay more money as a deposit to receive a replacement device that was still in its warranty period. I ended up buying a Samsung Galaxy instead of paying a deposit and sent my device back for replacement. Motorola should stand behind it's products, including the ""deposit"" for replacing said devices if they are in warranty."
else	The first time I called the individual said he couldn't help! So not a good call there - I called Lenovo # on internet screeen. The second time I called 2 hours later Rachell was very helpful and tlked/walked me through the process. Excellent service.
Agent	Customer service agent lack of product knowledge, and only basic troubleshooting skill.
else	About my laptop in November, received it in December of 2018, and right away had problems with the shift key. I sent it in for repair, and got it back, and it had two more problems. It would not turn on, most of the time without clicking the reset button in back, and the USB port would not work and kept showing a power surge on USB port error. I called back to customer service, and told them I wanted a replacement because I thought this device was a lemon. This is supposed to be the top of the line ThinkPad product. However the tech support team could not offer me a replacement, so they forwarded me to the sales department. The sales department forwarded me to post sales department. The post sales department was completely not helpful, and extremely frustrating. They offered absolutely no option to resolve my problem such as exchanging for a new device, or extending or upgrading the warranty so that I feel confident in the product. It was incredibly frustrating and at this point the only option I have is to write a bad review online.
else	Collect the necessary information once and not re ask for it every time I call them. It would also be nice that they take care of calling back when they say they would instead of having to call you back 3 times to finally not get any results...
else	Thoroughly check equipment for damages when received so additional repairs can be made for paid customers.    Run some diagnostic tests to be sure that all equipment is functioning as desired.  I understand that Lenovo has gotten a bad batch of replacement LCDs ( in the case of Gen 1 yogas)  but I should not receive equipment with a replaced screen that does not function correctly.  Returning equipment is easy but having to send back equipment that has reported as been repaired and having to send back again is just frustrating.
else	No one came as expected and I never received a call.
else	It was late...it took 10 days to return my mobile
else	Better communication, clear updates and a better explanation of the issue
else	Wait time for parts availability
else	The device took almost seven months to be returned and there was no communication as to why it took so long. Since normal turnaround time is about a week, this is a monumental amount of time for service.
else	Hi ,,  Hindi is not a national language okay  ,, we are in Karnataka So please  feedback language list in add Kannada also .
else	Improve price quote time frame, and response time and provide reseller channel for price to their customers
else	Poor services, not on time, poor service engineer response
else	still waiting for a service engineer to make contact
else	Please timely update the status of the SR
else	Should have let me know why the motherboard spoiled when I came to pick the repaired laptop instead of saying no clue, until I and they  knew that the battery was faulty which was the reason that the motherboard  spoiled, when I came back the second time, when my the laptop was not charging after the repairs.
else	The wrong part was sent twice and ultimately I had to send the laptop in for Depot service to get it repaired.
else	fulfill a promised call-back maybe
else	Have better stock on parts. Add more techs in this area to ensure that the NBD SLA is met.
else	Customer-services training to your technical team. I found the first technician who came to address the issue I had to be very dismissive and unwilling to hear out my issues.
else	faster repair time especially when i pay for on site repair.
else	1.  Improve Level 1 technical support and published support number, I had to search the web and hunt for the support number, and ending up calling customer service instead.2.  Stock of parts and materials. The 30 days lead time to resolution was due to a backorder on the system board.
else	I was not notified when the technician came out
else	Still waiting for phone return
else	Quicker availability of replacement parts.
else	Make sure the engineer has the correct part on first visit
else	Faster parts delivery to tech. Clear location of delivery. Check with tech, as he reported some confusion.
else	Find overseas call reps that actually LISTEN to what you're saying.
else	I am extremely unhappy that  my computer was returned with Bit Locker which it did not have before and no one could tell me the reference key to access my computer.
else	Need technical training  to Your diagnostic team
else	Faster return shipping
else	Thoroughly test machines before returning to avoid downtime / additional returns. Include an option for customers to drop off the item at local DHL Express Centre if they can't wait at home between 9 and 5 for pick up.
Agent	Each case should have a checklist of information obtained during the first call to avoid unnecessary repetition of questions and procedures in case a second call is falls on a different assistant. I had this problem and is was kind of annoying.
else	Pathetic & hopeless service support, I had number of times requested product replacement but they busy wasting time to repair and still the product is not delivered same still with service center.
else	Be able to meet the one business day service.  In this case we waited over a month to get the part and eventually got a new machine because of the delays.
else	Received damaged parts
else	hire experienced and sound knowledge people
else	be faster and return the item damage free
else	Use reps who can speak understandable English. It was bad enough that the online chat couldn't resolve my question, so I had to call customer service, but then had to work with someone who couldn't be understood. I asked her to put someone on whose first language was English, but she ignored my request.
else	Verify that the part is shipped.
else	Ensure the correct part is shipped; saves time for the technician and the customer.
else	Communicate a wee bit more proactively with needed parts are delayed
else	The computer was returned without any description of problem, items replaced, etc.
else	Listen carefully and employ suitable partner to deliver services. Part required was delivered late by DHL defeating the purpose.
else	- Send a tech when promised.- Don't tell your partners they are incorrect when there's documentation stating otherwise.- Send parts to the desired location
else	Give more updates on the status of the repair and if someone is waiting on a part for a repair, provide the tracking info for the part they are waiting on.
else	there was confusion regarding which delivery company you use: while I received SMS from FedEx, your email indicate a different company
else	returns faster
else	Wanted to charge  305 to  to repair a faulty HD that was no fault of user  it was 4 months out of warranty it only cost 325 new
else	Do not notify of updates without saying how long they will take.
else	faster response time in chat window from tech
else	Not keep unit at depot for over 13 days for no apparent reason.
else	I didn't receive my laptop yet. I have no idea where it is.
else	Don't force someone to give feedback.
else	This is an ongoing repeat technical problem that Lenovo cannot resolve after many repeated attempts, which has led now to a complaint that has yet to reach an acceptable conclusion.
else	Send right part. Still waiting. Its be about 3 weeks and still need my lab top fixed. Still waiting for my part to arrive.
else	customer is not able for problem trubulsutting self  he is operator of computer  he has no  knowledge of computer hardware
else	Additional communication when shipping parts directly to customer.  Part was received containing installation information as if for self-install.  A day later the technician called to schedule appointment to install just as self-install was about to take place.
else	send not refurbished parts
else	There seems to be a problem with your local vendor, specifically with scheduling when to come out. There was no contact by them for three days after they received the parts.
else	Recall the faulty parts timely.
else	Start trusting customers & value their feedback.
else	Better tracking of what is happening with the workstation while it is sent in.  The notes were really good for a while, and then a week went by with no updates.  Was it waiting for something?
else	Not to have people hang on the phone for ages.  My phone bill has doubled this month because of this. Make more options.
else	as per commitment your service engineer didn't come for bios update.that to be for a 8 days before system.
else	Lenovo didn't listen to problem and shipped unit back broken. The phone rep then directed me to take the unit 1 1/2 hours to a repair shop that wasnt authorized to work on it. Had to drive back 1 1/2 hours to retrieve it. Computer is back at depot repair.
else	better on-site service, and better replacement parts.
Agent	Do a follow up because the problem is not fixed.
else	Add Lenovo tablet option on automated technical support phone system options so people don't have to try several times to get to the correct place for help. For example: I was not aware my Lenovo tablet TBX103F was called an IDEA pad, therefore it took me several calls to get through. When I reached the correct place all went smoothly.
else	After the service my laptop is experiencing sudden restarts with blue screen of death. I would like an technical person to look at this issue
else	Make part return easier and less time consuming
else	Get my computer back when you advertise it to be returned. Dont make me call/chat 6 times in the span of a couple weeks to get yall to expedite the process. When a computer just needs a diagnostic run, put that at the front of the priority line because its so easy to do. Do not have my computer (which has been repaired and waiting for a diagnostic) sit for a month while I do not have computer access. Communicate better with the repair depot to get repairs processed quicker.
else	Support team didn't explain that the courier was already booked when they emailed the return labels. Therefore I needed the laptop collecting form work, but they scheduled my home address.
else	respond to my call. an email was promised but not received
else	It was not solved and I haven't heard from any of the onsite technician contact me at all. Now yall ask for my opinion?
else	I had a  problem with the instructions on   what  steps to take to  return the  ThinkpadThe  instructions  were  beyond  my  knowledge  of  computers (use  of  initials  /  acronyms ) . I had to call tech  service  for  help,  and  in the  end  I  was told  to  ignore  most of the  instruction  because of the  type of problem I was experiencing with the computer  ( i.e.  fan error) .   Just  something  to consider,  we are not all tech  savvy.. The  tech  service   rep(  Dalton)  was  very  helpful..
else	The call center staff were rude, used technical jargon and the first contact did not deal with my query
else	My phone was returned in a timely manner.
else	My computer was bricked by the latest Windows 10 update and I had to pay 70 locally to have it rebuilt. Lenovo offered to pick up and assess my computer for repairs, but last time that happened they lost my (other) computer for weeks on end and I was offered no compensation. I do not trust Lenovo service and will not buy another Lenovo product. However, the servie assistants were courteous and I cannot fault them personally. But Lenovo as a whole did not resolve my issue.
else	Send a a box for the return. The school that owned the laptop did not have a suitable box and the packaging that the sent the laptop back in was adequate but ultimately did not bounce.
else	Well, my computer came back for the 4th time not working. But this time I was demanded to pay to replace the charger that was in Roma Ted as the problem. It wasnt. I asked repeatedly for the computer to now be replaced entirely. Its still not and Im incapacitated in my work. This is now a serious issue and I will investigate what measure I should take. Unless you guys wake up and replace it for good.
else	Provide technician with the correct parts to resolve the issue at first attempt.
else	The parts which were replaced didn't worked at all after some time and which lead to complete system failure
else	faster to get to site to do the repair and better supply of spare parts.
else	expedite the SLA and service response
else	Improve wait time, and transferring calls between different departments
else	provide status updates on the Lenovo website -- the tool is in place but just was not used.
else	Some of the service center's excutive were not so professional as they had to be
else	Send new original part rather than sending used parts
else	it was very difficult to figure out how to access the update information
else	your representative was a bit hard to understand on the phone
else	Stop selling products that are not fit for purpose - 32gb emmc  laptops with windows 10 which cant update. Marketing info said easy to update for years to come not true
Agent	Waiting on address to send to repair agent or be replaced for customer. Haven't heard back as of yet.
else	Develop a local partnership with technicians in bend Oregon
else	When they take new phones for service, we expect a backup phone to be given to be used till we get back our phone. This was not taken care and also phone was not returned on time.
else	Lenovo is just throwing parts at it.  No troubleshooting or diagnosis.  Now device is being replaced all together.
else	Make sure that the technician assigned to replace parts contacts us before the part arrives if it is a part they will be swapping.
else	I called for the 2nd time on the same problem. The first time they sent a LCD to be replaced. When I called the second time, the CS rep on the phone said they would not send someone out to fix the computer unless I update the BIO's. My computer goes into sleep mode when I move the monitor screen on the laptop. When I asked to speak with a supervisor, he said there wasn't one so I asked for a call back which I've never received. If they would contact the technician that came out the first time, they would know what is needed to repair the laptop correctly.
else	Pick up the call faster
else	appreciate followup call from Lenovo technician after receiving online complaint report
else	I'm waiting for a part from another supplier (cyberport.de)
else	With regards to this call it's the second of this model of laptop with a fan failure after just a few months, so I suppose the obvious thing to say is fix the fan so we don't need to log a call in the first place! Other than that, the call was fine; a bit slow but that wasn't really a problem this time around.
else	Decrease wait time for pc parts
else	Not proper response.I could no talk to  senior/ Manager Mail seen to Mr.Sudhin Mathur (CEO) sudhin.mathur@motorola.com was not received & rejected.Now I am going to consumer forum.
else	I submitted an electronic ticket and got an email indicating that within 30 minutes I wold receive instructions on how to proceed to get service for my computer.  I waited a day and there was no instructions.  I called the premier support number and spent 90 minutes on hold before giving up.  I then called the regular Lenovo Thinkpad support line and they told me that since I had premier service they could not help me.  I then spent another 90 minutes on hold before giving up.  I tried resubmitting my repair request online only to receive an email that my request could not be processed.  Presumably this was because I had already submitted an online request already.  So I called the Premier Support phone number once again and just left my phone listening to the music for nearly 2 hours.  Finally someone picked it up and i was able to receive assistance.  I am extremely upset -- I paid heavily for onsite premier support, but what I got was a dead end rabbit hole that excluded me from the regular Lenovo support.  There must be a better way to handle large call volumes on Lenovo Premier Support.
else	My laptop returned from warranty exactly with the same problem.
else	provide phone support.
else	faster repair turnaround
else	there was no communication from service center on updates. we followed up with the service center all the time. call no was also not given. and they told to follow up with toll free no . we received some information from toll free no which was not maching with service center
else	with the service I received it could not have gotten better excallent
else	Come up with better solutions than have to mail my tablet in, and also put your telephone number on your website. It's like you don't want people to know how to reach you. I had to download a user manual to get the number.
else	Improve listening and technical skills. Lenovo techs need to listen and understand the issue. This particular issue still isn't resolved. It  has been almost a month with 3 different Lenovo case numbers assigned to one problem. This is just one of our problems. We have another outstanding one that has been in the works for a few months. And, that issue still isn't resolved.
else	The part were left at UPS for days before i received a call from a local tech.
else	employees don't have knowledge about device
else	Faster resolution of problems
else	Not return it broken?
else	no response
else	Better updates on status of machine. Was very difficult to contact someone who knew where my machine was, and when it might be ready.
else	As I have already kindly improve your remote technical support team both in terms of technical support and custimer mail response time.If possible provide escalation matrix in the signature.
else	Time of PC repair/spare parts delivery
else	Reduce wait time to get parts. it took nearly 4 weeks from date ticket opened to technician got the parts.
else	Better treat your customers by giving them updates and not keep them in the lurch and having to call in themselves. If repair is taking too long, offer a laptop loan or something similar. People often need their laptops urgently for work, and without a laptop during the repair period can cause a lot of inconvenience.
else	When calling for information about the ticket, wait for said information before returning the device. Additionally, as someone who works in information security, I do not believe it acceptable to request all password in order to troubleshoot.
else	Let your representatives know of issues that you are having with updates before a customer calls.
else	Use new parts instead of refurbished ones.  Two refurbished used failed.
else	The turn around on this repair was very slow. It wasn't until I made a call that I found out the repair depot was waiting for an out-of-stock part. Some sort of update telling me this would have greatly reduced my frustration.
else	Don't take a month and a half to return a product. Also keep updates on the product easily accessible.
else	In my Moto set the main problem was that while i was using cell while charging lots of apps automatically starts to open & close, & the set hang frequently,   When I visited on first day on 17th they updated the software, the problem was not solved, Again visited very next day , I had to deposit the set , as I was told that screen was to be replaced. I got the set on 25jan,  But the problem was still not sort out. I was out of town for few days, yesterday i visited again, they again tried to update some software, but the problem continues
else	I have received zero updates on my open cases.
else	problem reoccurred on next day
else	Should expedite the resolution of the issue.
else	Still wait for update on s/n and model on the BIOS
else	Provide a mailing box, or offer a new swap unit
else	Replacement part check
else	There was a few day delay between the time the laptop was received to when I was notified it was put on billing hold.   Service level (getting our laptop back) is very important to our business - we need a fast turnarond to the timeframe originally quoted.
else	Communicate better on the status of my computer repair, do the repairs faster.
else	Please resolve issue on time which is share by you.
else	speed up repair times, better comms from support team
else	Stop suing cheap parts
else	Communication with Lenovo technical support was difficult and seemed disorganized
else	Fix the issue on time
else	There were software issues after I received the laptop back. I had to use system restore.
else	My computer started to have issues in the first month of use and for all the reviews I've ready about that model (unfortunately I read the reviews after I bought the computer), the problems my computer had are common in the yoga series. So make better computer and help your costumers  the first time they make a complaint do not make your customers contact Lenovo three times to get their problems fixed.
else	Took over 2 weeks to have a simple keyboard replaced for a new laptop that was DOA. The service desk were slow with responding to updates. onsite technician however was prompt.
else	Solve the issue that caused the return.
else	My screens were frozen when my computer was reset and returned to me.  I have not been able to callBecause Ive been in the hospital but I need helpTo even change time from pacific to eastern on theFirst page which is greed out and then update theOther pages before I can even try to sign on.
else	Availability of the parts
else	improve the wait times for customer support hotlines
else	More communication when call is closed
else	kindly notify the exact date of return while taking the product for service
else	Provide regular updates
else	No response to calls or emails
else	The serviceman was from a third-party service provider and he wasn't familiar with the hardware of my Lenovo Y700 notebook. It'd be better if the servicemen have been trained specifically for Lenovo products.
else	Faster turnaround for parts delivery. Hewlett packard is able to deliver parts within 48 hours (worst case).  I've been waiting for close to 2 x months.
else	See previous comment about return delivery.
else	Quality of the Lenovo needs improving, this is the third repair of the computer display.
else	Answer the phone quickerr
else	More regular updates and explanation direct from Lenovo. If I know how long it will take to repair, I can look for other solutions. Duncan (engineer) was fantastic and I felt all was in safe hands once he was involved. Up until that point I had no clue about progress, expected resolution time or how issue would re solved
else	Provide Service on time and that you commit to customer.
else	part should be deliver with in 2 days
else	feedback for Service Request : 7008961115.More time has been spent but problem of pc not resolved till now. why lenovo not serious on their service and to their customer. its showed that lenovo service is very poor. we purchased 30 nos of lenovo PC but in future for new deals of electronics items or any computer accessories we are not going for lenovo.
else	Quoted time to fix when including delivery times is too long at approx 2 weeks.
else	Please ensure that the parts supplied to service engineers match the issue and the laptop model. If not, do not send service engineers with wrong parts. Service engineer was aware of the wrong parts he received and yet he travelled 40km to take chance. It would have been annoying if the issue didn't resolve by the luck of chance by reassembling the laptop without replacing any part.
else	Get rid of https://www.managedtechnicalsupportaccess.com/ because it is rubbish
else	Speed up the return process
else	Provide the tech with the correct/neccessary parts.Have the tech test the system thouroughly
else	Better call handling, better understanding and communications with its customers in terms of geographical location, better communications start to end of fault resolution. Post resolution communication.
else	By simplifying the downloading of required updates.
else	At least make it faster to contact you guys and start the repairing process. Or you should compensate some other things for the delaying and the unpleasant experience.
else	Service desk need improvements on their troubleshooting knowledge.
else	Maintaining response time and update the changing status
else	intermittent issue, not reoccuring
else	I did not receive any notification of status prior to the device showing back up at the door.  Would have been nice to have a tracking number at least so I'd know someone needed to be there to receive it.  Luckily someone was.
else	Have the parts for computers on active warranty on hand so there are not delays.
else	Use only New parts
else	Check unit before its sent back
else	Back and forth just transferd calls and no one interested to provide solution. Looks like they dont care about customer
else	"My  computer was returned ,with a  comment the power cord was  not charging , and  ""ordering""   I assume this means your company is replacing the charger as it is all under warranty .   No other comment was made  as in  when it would be shipped etc .. SO I just wait ..."
else	A defective system board has prevented resolution of the recall so far.  The defective system board has to be fixed first.
else	Super slow response time from Sam
else	Missing part never received
else	The primary memory in the computer is not enough to honor antiviral updates
else	still waiting for someone to contact
else	I have to return the laptop because there were damages
else	Service Centre appearance and professionality shall be improved. It looked like a 3rd rate office and procedures weren't very professional.
else	warranty update which is not up to date warranty when we bought online laptops
else	Quitck resolution of costumer problems
else	The service centre does not provide update facility as in Bengaluru they update the loptop in latest version of windows 10 , if you have software. But facility is not in Kolkata. Which I am not liking it at all..
else	I cannot fault the service I received  from your customer service adviser when a rang for help when my laptop developed a fault. I received an email as promised following day confirming you would carry out the repair free of charge together with a returns label and a collection date for collection.  It was collected, repaired and returned to me in less than 2 weeks. Amazing service which could not be bettered.  Thank you
else	improve windows update in system
else	Very poor knowledge technician in my area centre. My mobile charging was very slowly I was go to service centre they was didn't repair my Mobile. They didn't know any knowledge.
else	Make the phone number easier to find for specific countries. Let Lenovo product owners know when there is a possibility of an update not working and may prevent your product from turning on.
else	More service centres and repair faster
else	Not transfer me to an Indian call center where I can hear other people talking so loud I can't hear the person trying to speak to me.
else	They repaired one thing but the laptop slowed after repair i don't know y
else	I have not received back my laptop yet. I have been waiting for more than 1 month with no information about my laptop location or status....... I can understand mistakes can happen, but knowing nothing it is ridiculous. Lenovo has the shitiest service what I have ever encountered in my life. If tomorrow I will not hear anything about my laptop, I am going to write a letter to the Danish Ombudsman, because it is unbelievable.
else	Better take my laptop and keep it with you guys, based on the track record i have contacted multiple with Lenovo customer service for my laptop issues and after every few months it comes with the same issue. So you guys better keep it to yourself. I'm tired of this shit already
else	Better response from point of sale
else	I had Lenovo before and I was encouraged to buy this one. This unit I got  with the issue I have from the beginning had made me to think of other brand.
else	The customer service was poor in scheduling the order of parts, technician assignment and sending the correct part. Due to this the job took more than 2 weeks.
else	"I haven't received my product back yet so I can't answer the above question honestly. My service date also is not 1/1/19 and that is what is stated in this survey.  I just put in a service request a few weeks ago.  The box that I was supposed to receive ""the next day"" took two weeks to get shipped to me."
else	when a case is submitted through the MTA website have someone actually read what was submitted and respond within a reasonable time frame. I have a case that I submitted 6 days ago and I still have not received a box. case #405JM6L your customer service is at an all time low.
else	Better co-ordination of engineer and parts arrival. Engineer previously came with part. Now part is shipped to customer and engineer through no fault of their own arrives when part has been delivered.
else	Wrong part was sent
else	By not giving mis-leading information regarding repair times and having a repair agent in Ireland or even the UK instead of having to send to Germany.
else	Get the parts to the technician within 24 hours.
else	Because ,i am not received my moto c plouse phone at right time
else	My computer was returned late and with the same problem.  I had to ship it back again 2 weeks after receiving it.  Now Fedex can not track it with the way Bill number I was provided and it has not arrived at your repair centre.
else	Improve communication with customer about service related queries and updates regarding the issue.
else	Have better English speaking techies and eliminate all the background noise.
else	Well you did send the wrong coloured part, but hey, mistakes happen, right?
else	You can start by honouring your warranty. Maybe ask yourselves this: How would you feel if you paid a lot of money for a faulty product and then were deprived of that product for the next seven months while the most incompetent and unprofessional company you'd ever dealt with attempted and failed multiple times to fix it, and then refused to give you a refund or a replacement? Do you think that's fair treatment of a customer? Do you think that qualifies as honouring the warranty?
else	I received several emails about the service. They weren't entirely clear if the part was self-installed (one of the emails seemed to indicate so) or on-site service was provided.
else	Have more promotions and update on the latest products
else	Having a bad experience with my E580 because the Singapore service centre  do not keep the system board,and have to wait for part from China .That is not good. This clearly show that you don't have a system or your people not doing their work.
else	i waited a week for my return label to show up in the mail.  the customer service lady told me it would be mailed to me. When i called back the person told me that it should've been emailed to me. so i was without my phone for a week.  My phone worked perfectly before it asked for an update.  After the update it would not work at all.
else	to use lenovo parts onl
else	Not make me wait over a week for the part to be replaced.
else	Due to the delay in their service and every update i got only when i visited their store
else	send the right part the first time  :)
else	Pls collect correct & updated warranty details from retailers
else	Verify parts stock
else	Respond on status update requests. Be more clear in communications, Respond faster. Align your way of working with the party that performs the actual repairs.
else	Need to make the part ready for replacement
else	Didn't even provide service for my phone within warranty period
else	Honor next day service.  We were told a tech wouldnt be available until on week after ticket was opened.  We had tech drop off part and we installed.  Horrible service.
else	fix issues first time round, and then when you don't you need to offer some form of loan equipment, so the end user doesn't have to wait over 5 weeks for their unit back in working order...i found the support very VERY poor.
else	Still waiting on the replacement pen. When are you going to ship it?
else	achieve faster response times, better phone system and do what say will do- I had to wait three weeks for a  home visit to repair laptop which was done on 21`st May and am still waiting for USB stick to install Microsoft programmes as disks were wrongly sent  as I have no disk drive. I still cant use the laptop
else	online chat, Faster response to phone call, walk through resolution instead of just sending paper instructions
else	Not replace one part at a time. Do not send calls from US to India. Do not say the part is back ordered With an unknown delivery date and then arrives the next day.
else	Check the product for any issues before returning it to the buying consumer
else	Apparently when the tech showed up the first time he didn't have the right part and had to come back a second time. Clearer information about what was really wrong. Because we're a rural area, there's not a local technician so it took a long time for someone to even turn up to look at it.
else	Your website for checking the status of repairs is very slow, and pressing the Enter key after entering in the repair number and serial number clears the data instead of submitting it, which is frustrating.
else	This required 2 service calls, as the proper part was not sent with the technician and the issue was not resolved on the first call.
else	Improve call centre, dont make mistakes ordering parts, follow up when you promise to do so
else	Send the correct parts to the technicians so I can get my laptop uo and running sooner. It took close to three weeks for the right part to be shipped, and it took three trips by the technicians to finally repair my laptop.
else	Incorrect part sent
else	if the issue isn't fixed, or you are unsure if it is fixed, then you should set up a call to the customer for next day to see how things are playing out.  follow up with the customer until the issue is resolved.
else	Reply to emails / give me updates / engineer just turned up at office without me knowing.
else	Still waiting for the parts to be installed
else	Respond to emails received. Re examine the company policy regarding faulty machines, and how to find a mutually beneficial solution. The customer service must be greatly improved, as I did not get the impression my satisfaction was important.
else	After the initial ticket was logged, I had just one missed call from someone over the Christmas break and then they closed the ticket. No email, no further attempts at contact. Then we had to open a new ticket.  Don't want any calls or follow up from Lenovo, just leaving it with my IT department if anything further has to be done.
else	As I stated before, same error multiple machines. Better quality parts or a recall on the machines to fix them before they become problems.
else	better updates and communication
else	No hassles very professional
else	See my laptop suddenly stop working which shows that product is not well equipped or whatever the technical problem is..it happened within 6months if m not wrong.so thought is that try to improve while making it.at the end quality matters
else	The issue is not resolved - the motherboard did not work and I'm still waiting to hear back on resolution.
else	Wasn't your end, it was just waiting for parts.
else	Because I asked for the replacement part to be  shipped to me for replacement by me (which saves your companay additional labor costs), I was told that any further warranty on that part is null (a part that was poorly engineered and failed prematurely in 2 different ways (keyboard failure and rubber trim falling off the palmrest)).. that is not acceptable.. but I have no choice unless I want to lose the use of my device for days while a technician that may or may not have the same level of skill (or care) I have does the same thing I would.  Also... My first chat was disconnected after everything was agreed upon and the resolution was decided, but they didn't complete the order, nor try to reconnect with me. They had my contact information.. why not call and say they weren't done yet. They cancelled the order and didnt share that they did. In fact..they sent notice that it was resolved. I had to do another chat session to fiind out they cancelled it, and then get the part shipped. Had i not checked.. there was no indicator that my service order was cancelled.
else	Reduce the wait time and provide more clear automated instructions about choices.
else	Cure issues with third party that did the repair.  Contact was appalling (again, I thought it was a phishing scheme), I was informed I was being billed hundreds of dollars before any repairs would be made, and had to spend the better part of an hour on the phone to resolve the issues.
else	Depends on the outcome - my laptop is only a year or so old and no longer takes a battery charge.
else	Need to keep customers informed, example, phone call or email to arrange time for pickup and return
else	Diagnose the problem at the first opportunity
else	There was a long long wait time on the phone. 15 minutes is excessive.
else	The Parts department sent the wrong monitor and then it took another month for the right monitor to come in.
else	Service Rep had the wrong return address on file and sent my laptop TO SOME BUSINESS ADDRESS COMPLETELY UNRELATED!!!   I was told the only way to fix was to contact the shipper and the shipper refused to talk to me as my address wasnt the delivery address provided by Lenovo. I wasted time off of work and can fare to track down my laptop before it disappeared. Lenovo service leaves much to be desired. Useless.
else	Need better call handling experience. Less delays , easier access and better trained technicians.
else	I was told one thing by one person and something else by another. I had to tell my situation over each time I spoke with someone then I received something that was totoally unrelated with no explanation. I ended up paying when I was told I wouldn't be charged. Very frustrating.
else	Unit returned but cannot boot
else	return to store
else	Lenovo team is not taking my laptop hanging issue seriously i have reset the window 5times and still hanging issue ia occuring they even changed my harddisk 2times and not changing the important part sd drive, motherboard and ramLenovo should replace the parts their software is not able to recognize the issue Lenovo service is very very poor as compared to dell and other laptop company services
else	"No email mentioned that an engineer was visiting to replace a part.The email notifying me of the part been delivered gave links to ""Do it yourself"". You comms needs to me more specfic."
else	It should not take 2 hours to get someone on the phone
else	Bad technical service at customer care service.
else	Besides the sound no longer functioning While preparing to package the unit with failed plastics the screen cracked while trying to get the computer screen to close for shipping invalidating my warranty as it is considered physical damage.
else	Communicate problems with me as I didn't mind waiting but I was never informed and had to chase your support team multiple times to get an update.
else	Keep more parts in stock
else	More communication, I had to call twice to get updates. I was told twice that I would get an e-mail with an update and that never happened.
else	make sure parts you send for replacement are functioning.   A part was sent that did not work.
else	Provided more timely updates.  My machine was on hold for almost 1 month, and no one reached out to me about it.  I had to proactively call Lenovo and its service repair outsourced group to get a story.  Even then was it difficult to get a hold on anyone.
else	Reduce the number of times of fixing by providing quality parts would help
else	The issue, as explained to me, was a Microsoft capability issue which is the cause of the short battery life compared to quoted life. Microsoft was made aware of the issue, but no resolution has been implemented based on my battery life situation. The rep was very very good and understanding of the situation. However, no follow-up as to the resolution. At one point in time a potential return and replacement of a different device was a potential offer, but that seems to have gone away.  Very unfortunate.
else	Improve parts delivery time
else	My Amazon account  was hacked into after I contacted customer service for an audio issue I had following the return of my laptop. The technician had remoted in to assist with issue, but I never saw her disconnect from my computer because it had to be restarted and there were updates taking a long time, so she told me she was ending the call and to call back if the audio issue continued. The next morning, there was a tab open on my laptop for amazon.com and a purchase made on my amazon account using my check card number.
else	Calling Lenovo is a horrible experience, with long wait times on the phone, a really bad automation system, and lots of changes to separate departments, each with their own wait time.  Definitely one of the longest, least productive and truly maddening support calls I've ever been party to.
else	Improve the product or to acknowledge it is a common issue for the product line to the customer (MOE).
else	your lenovo tp13 modal huge problem with battery backup and crack screen bezal part its facing problem all lenovo tp 13 modal
else	Depot missunderstood complaint for repair and changed more than the battery. Returned to customer with a keyboard failure which lead to a return to Depot.
else	services on time and identify issue in first attempt
else	Provide better technical support, and make sure problems are solve before sending the units back to customers. It's really annoying to receive it in the same conditions as it was sent, and have to send it back again.
else	Reduce wait time and ensure staff members are fully equipped with knowledge of the products.
else	Nothing much, though the service web page was hard to use and could receive an update.
else	At first, my phone was not received by the service center. But after I mailed the customer helpline it got serviced in a day which was quiet satisfactory. But now my phone's display starts trembling in an unusual manner which was not the problem before I gave my phone to the service center. I am looking forward to submit my phone again in the service center.
else	Since the bios update, my laptop hasn't crashed. I would have liked you to tell me why it crashed. You didn't really diagnose, only wiped and reimaged.
else	I included the AC adapter with the laptop but it was not returned.  I called to request a replacement and received the power adapter without the ac cord.  I had to make a second call and wait for the second shipment before I could return the working unit to the customer.
else	Just found it a bit difficult to find contact details on the website....
else	Please Improve part order process.
else	Better communication among different teams and faster updates. The issue has not been resolved and I have received a new SO: 7008418189 /  SR: 8010416079
else	three major parts replaced and still does not work
else	nearly two weeks later and no resolution. Communication from call centre very poor. still awaiting call and correct part to be sent. Engineer who attended site very helpful, no issues.
else	the only problem was the pc power adapter was not return with the PC
else	no knowledge to service engineers and customer support try to improve customer support to resolve issues faster so that end user customer dont have any problem.
else	show up on time?
else	Have the correct status represented on the website - this would have prevented me from having to contact support to find out the status of the repair.  The website didn't even indicate the computer was received by Lenovo
else	Establish call centers in the USA so that customers can talk to Americans.
else	Kindly do service on time
else	The same problem reoccurs within days
else	as already noted re: return shipment & signature not being required.
else	You should keep updated the staus on web site during the service
else	Have more parts stocked locally so I won't have to wait an extra day for service while part is shipped.
else	multiple weak display issues (physically breaking) broke during replacement, shipment, etc. on 4th LCD; had to replace motherboard, ribbon cable. now all housings are loose and seems are exposed. loose screws,etc. at this point I was supposed to receive a new machine - it's been ordered; but nothing has been sent to me. it's been well over 2 weeks.
else	Shorten telephone wait times by hiring more well- trained technical support staff.  At the 1-800 565-3344 number, train the staff to provide good technical support or cancel the number as there is not help at that number!
else	I don't believe I should have to get 3 replacement phones before I getr one that WORKS!!! I also was told  when I asked for the latest phone to be shipped to me without getting a security hold on my charge card, that I would get an answer back within 48 hours. They DID NOT tell me that weekends WERE NOT included in that estimation of the time it would take to get a return call!
else	I need updated
else	"The laptop was returned and does not recognize the SSD drive. I called customer support, they could only tell me to hit the reset button after powering off, not helpful.  One if the times I did that it booted up, the next time it would not boot, I called again and the technician told me the ""system was down"" and could not order another box to ship the laptop back for service and could not apparently pass on a message to a colleague to make a ticket once the system comes back on line.  Is there no email? No supervisor?"
else	send the right parts for my laptop
else	My phone I received does the same thing my old phone did so I can't recommend Motorola very dissatisfied
else	facilitate a resolution of the problem if not able to fix it yourselves
else	Nothing in these circumstances as the problem was caused by a Windows update crashing my PC.
else	The first time I called the rep asked for receipt date I think in addition to serial# and told me no service can be provided. Later Square trade rep called Lonovo rep then put me on line wth them. 2nd fixed the problem.
else	Make sure that the person fulfilling the parts order ships the correct part and the the part is being sent to the correct recipient.
else	Expedite parts deliveries...especially when the total repair time approaches 10 days.  My issue took 18 days to resolve, 8 of those days were days out for delivery which included Saturdays.  Saturdays should be a delivery day.
else	Incorrect part was sent first time. Correct part was on back order for a long time.
else	I am disatisfied that the device that I received will only be covered by the original warrenty of the faulty device. The original device malfunctioned without explanation, and I am concerned that a new device will only do the same, although this time it will be out of warranty and I will have no options.
else	Quicker service with more improved updates on what is happening with the call
else	Be more responsible and repair faster, also provide updates
else	"Automatic upgrades by Microsoft (every time I open my laptop) are constantly depleting ALL the data on my pre-paid modem.  I have attempted several times (with the assistance of Lenovo support) to disable these upgrades and updates but no success.  I have to keep ""topping up"" my modem.  I simply want basic use ie sending emails etc.  I DO NOT WANT to pay $80 per month to simply send emails.  NOTHING WORKS re disabling these updates.  While Lenovo support staff have attempted to assist and been very patient etc STILL EVERY TIME I OPEN MY LAPTOP AND AUTOMATIC UPDATE LAUNCHES AND IT TAKES 10-15 MINS TO QUICKLY LOG OFF, LOG ON ETC IN AN ATTEMPT TO PREVENT THE UPDATE/UPGRADE. I DO NOT NEED THESE CONSTANT UPDATES."
else	Always provide URL for download updated driver. IF you have any software diagnose tool, it will help non technical end user to provide diagnose result to you for quick resolutions.
else	whatever the part of system is send to replace, lenovo should check it before and then transport it and also improve your customer service team, for updating customer regarding the status of item to be replaced. your email service is very poor they don't response early and check it.
else	Was not given bill and receipt with breakup for d charges on services of my phone.Hope i will receive receipt with breakup.
else	Faster service, Don't have to order the same part 3 times because you failed to properly do your job then make the user have to create and entirely new ticket because your Tech made a mistake.
else	keep spare parts in stock for Yoga
else	faster shipment to repair center and better notification of the process
else	The parts took really long to arrive, the shipment needs and improve.
else	I received two phone, from Motorola I am really disappointed with these two phones that I have received I was a true Motorola fan for so many years but these last two phones and now the one that I have now a great disappointment
else	faster response to enquiry, better quality control of product
else	Being on phone for way too long. More than 1 hour.
else	when opening the ticket, dispatch never asked where to deliver the part. it was delivered to the wrong address. we picked up part from wrong address and brought to site where the defective laptop was, and dispatched argued they could not send tech to this new location. Most inflexible system. Had to speak to Supervisor to make change and he was most in-cooperative, inflexible. whole situation lasted much longer than should have. Have had service from Lenovo before and it was nothing like this. hope this was an isolated issue and not the norm.
else	Fix and return my computer.  The machine has been in for repair for over a month.  Add to that the weeks of local troubleshooting that never fixed the issue.  So far, the machine has been at at least two different repair facilities and I've not received an update on the status of the repair in weeks.
else	fixing my computer faster, without me having to call every other day
else	part which you delivered in first time was faulty so please send always tested part
else	The time it took to fix and ship the computer back to me was slow. It has been over a month already and i still havent received my computer. I also didnt receive any shipping information online and had to call in for that.  The phone waiting time was also long.   It would be helpful to have that shipping info available online.  Overall i am satisfied that it should be all fixed without me having to pay further (though i did purchase extra warranty coverage)
else	Pay for returning a product like you do on laptops.
else	Better testing before returning
else	Pls send knowledge service rep.
else	no communication, very slow to respond and 4 weeks to fix
Agent	The second agent I spoke with to resolve this issue spoke with a strong accent.  It would be a better experience if I could easily understand your agent.
else	Provide a better timeframe as to when to expect the technician and when the customer calls to get an update, a more precise update is helpful.
else	Less time to get parts
else	fix it the first the first time, not the second.
else	punctuality
else	Make sure correct part is sent.  Lost almost a week because wrong part was delivered and tech had to order the correct one.
else	Improve the technical skills of the warranty agents via phone (custumer service)
else	There was no need for eginnner to visit a CR part, with the next business day call out we only get a 2 day response
Agent	The agent failed to review the windows error logs which provided clues as to the problem.
else	Decrease wait time for parts.
else	There was a long delay between my reporting the issue and receiving my return box.  But once you had the computer, the repair was very fast and I got my computer back quickly.
else	Better phones or mics for the people at customer service to use
else	Extremely bad behaviour and response by Lenevo service Enginner, totally unprofessional
else	The only aspect of my experience that could be improve would be to have the replacement part more / locally available.
else	As for TECH SUPPORT, usually when a customer calls in they are already having a frustrating moment. Doing stuff like saying you're going to transfer the customer to the sales department, then putting them on hold for a bit, just to transfer them back to the 1st menu, IS SUPER FRUSTRATING. When I worked tech support, or ANY customer service (PARTICULARLY over the phone), I always ensured my customer got to where they needed. I would stay on the line and introduce the caller to the person I am transferring them to, AFTER I explained the reason for the transfer to the other rep. Because, like I said, people are not calling in for fun. And chances are good they are already totally annoyed. Not only does it make EVERYONE'S life easier (a bad attitude can spread like a virus), it also makes the customer feel taken care of. Otherwise, my experience was pretty darn good. I very much appreciated the 1st tech NOT treating me like a dumb dumb by having me redo stuff I already did like power cycling, etc. Also, below, i chose it took multiple attempts, and that is because I had to run a full diagnostics test which took about 8 hours to complete. I had to call in, then deal with the sales dept, who then had me deal with a returns manager or whatever. But, it did take 1 call to be told to run the test, which was a good idea. So that is fine.
else	Still have mixed feelings about the support because there were problems with the replacement part. The one that was installed had a defect. Then the technician brought back another replacement again with the exact same defect. At some point they decided it would be better to offer me a whole new machine. On one hand, I'm happy that with Lenovo it's possible to get a whole new machine. On the other hand, it means that I have to switch over my whole work environment and all of the work, which is a bit difficult and impeding clients I have waiting. Better than nothing. But there should be better quality replacement parts available. I'm still waiting on the new laptop to come, but I'm glad that they have said I can have five days once it comes to transfer everything over from the old one, which is very good because it's my work computer.
else	Make sure the online service tracking is kept up to date.  Three weeks after I shipped the unit in for service I checked the tracker and it stated that Lenovo had not received my defective product yet.  I started checking with my shipping dept to make sure they shipped out the product and they assured me they had.
else	Provide me with instructions on how to return this product for a refund. I am very dissatisfied with the quality and performance on this product and service
else	The return box has not shipped yet.
else	sort out your team of repair engineers. They returned my faulty laptop after 2 weeks without doing anything with it. Had to pay someone to get it fixed privately in the end. You should compensate me for the inconvenience if you really care about the customer service, otherwise this survey is a complete waste of both of our time.
else	Better updates on Repair Status and Parts Backorder
else	Lenovo has to be faster at the time to fix any device
Agent	Shorter hold time to speak to a rep
else	Ensure you bring the correct part first time. On the first visit a mother board for a T470 was brought as the replacement, this was incorrect as my laptop is a T460.
else	Ensure leaves your service department in full working order. Touch Pad not working
else	Nothing - I have no complaints about the service I received
else	The 3 seperate technician visits to my home with no resolution rate a 5 (or perhaps lower).  The Factory Repair rates a 10.  Average it out to a 7.5 so an 8.
else	notify customers of the repair process, send notification emails that clearly identify such email as coming from Lenovo, provide a costumer web page that is more user friendly where the progress  of the repair may be tracked, and provide costumer service phone number where general questions can be asked and properly routed instead of three or four alternatives that may not be applicable to the costumer's situation. Virtually no updates on repairs are notified or estimated repair times provided, which is very frustrating to costumers needed their equipment repaired.
else	Have more engineers like the person who came for the third visit.
else	Replace units that are obviously 'duds' or 'lemons' as this one surely is.
else	Support needs to be more streamlined and keep the customer updated on what's going on so numerous calls aren't made wondering 'what's going on'.
else	Better facilitation of updates.
else	If there's a part-shortage and 'next business day' warranty cannot be honoured in a few days then send a replacement machine. It's unacceptable that this took months.
else	Very long time spent on phone to figure out simple problem. I could have been asked what I wanted to do early on and the problem could have been solved.
else	expedite part order shipping out
else	The unit failed after 3 days of service. I don't know how to find an issue like that other than have a lengthy b urn
else	Actually install the update that caused the initial failure.
else	You can provide one day delivery of spare parts. Also you can extend the online services to all pincodes.
Agent	Proper follow up
else	I Just give my product to service center for motherboard damage of my mobile they assured me for 7 days but within 4 days i have received a email for collecting the same. And  now approx 25 days completely done without any problem.
else	Emailing with updates on the status of the product. Giving a specific time frame of when repairs should be completed. Fully fixing the product before returning it to the customers. Making it easier to find repair shops nearby.
else	Fix my product in a timely manner and return the product without creating more issues
else	More frequent and timely status updates. Updates when a part is needed and on order.  Ship back faster than 6 day ground when I shipped it to you 2nd day priority.  SEND BACK THE POWER SUPPLY YOU HAD ME SEND WITH THE COMPUTER BUT YOU DID NOT RETURN.
else	Communication on the part delay was awful. I had to initiate every contact to get updates and I never did get an explanation of why it took so long to get the part.
else	The part took entirely too long to arrive (several weeks for a stick of RAM), and then it sat at the UPS depot for several days. I have not complaints about the onsite techs, they were great. Everything else was unacceptable for what my organization pays for coverage.
else	Make hardware and drivers that work without the very latest windows 10 update. (video card)
else	Faster shipping and tracking on incoming boxes.
else	Better testing before returning the item from the depot.
else	Don't send faulty parts as replacements
else	It would be better if they could send return label as its awkward if you haven't  a printer.
else	The wrong part was sent and I would like to send it back, the box was not opened , but the PC is working nowplease email me with return address so I can return the part
else	We were sent the wrong part the first time.  Now the computer overheats and shuts off.  A new ticket will need to be opened.
else	Lenovo needs to offer a better return policy.
else	The machine was serviced and returned promptly, but the issues was not resolved.
else	Do not breach contract and respond / repair devices within the timescales we have paid for.
else	When handling with the service laptop, the technician would be more careful so there would not be big scratch on the computer. My computer had issue when booting and replaced the SSD drive, but I am not sure if the BIOS is updated to latest version or not when it was reimaged.
else	They miscommunication regard the pick up or the part and part delivery could have been an issue is I was not home to sign for the parts. Stating that Lll parts would be available and then having to have the support rep return the next day when the primary part finally arrived
else	Turnaround time could be better, awaiting parts can cause delay
else	Need to send the right parts on first time to the tech
else	I sent my computer back with two complaints and I feel that only one was addressed. I received the computer back and am still having slight problems. I do not feel that my complaints were taken seriously. This is the second Lenovo laptop I have owned and I absolutely loved the first, however I am regretting buying my second one.
else	Better staff at Lenovo Service centre/ third party offline service centre cam be improved
else	Service center people need update regularly to customer
else	Provide more email updates, possibly a tracking number.
else	Was told someone would contact me .. did not
else	After owning your computer for over 3 months now it still doesnt work and is still at your repair depot for the second time. After paying for software support because I was 2 days late calling in for help after I set it up because it was the holidays and shipping time to me it didnt get set up until about 3 weeks from my purchased date. Miss 4 days of work being on the phone with your tech support only for them to say I have to mail to your repair center and I had to pay for the shipping the first time on a brand new unit that has a 1 year warranty on the hardware. Ive spend between 40 and 50 hours on the phone with your support people with no success. It was returned to me damaged and parts rattling around inside. Luckily I had picture showing it wasnt damaged when I mailed back to you. This is by far the worst support/warranty ever. After asking for a supervisor or customer service to just sent me a new unit or even a refund none of the representatives would transfer me or tell me who I needed to talk to. They just keep repeating the same thing over and over its insulting speaking with them because they act like they dont hear what your saying or refuse to acknowledge what your requesting. I own a small business and will never recommend Lenovo to anyone. Im sure no will reply to this complaint because it seems to be your policy.
else	send an engineer out with the part when stated, Still waiting
else	make sure that all the parts that are shipped for repair are returned
else	The N23 units take so long to get back.  Otherwise the service is good.
else	Provide services on time
else	2nd call, I was told it is a hardware problem and will have to send it in for repair.
else	increase staff and quick resolution to customer.
else	Send me another survey once you have completed my refund. I sent you security money regarding the return of my damaged phone. You received the phone but I haven't received the refund to my credit card yet.  There were also service and website issues that I will save for the next survey
else	I made many calls and finally returned unit for service, I brought another  moto silver one with 64 mem and it has started dropping calls????? Not as bad as old one but if it keeps it up I will just return it?  I returned my first moto for problems.  I need to buy another brand????
else	A bit quicker resolutions would not hamper our projects assignments and responsibilities. Because of 2-3 days wait time our work deliverable are getting hampered.
else	Organize the shipment of the replacement parts a little better. The part was delivered several times and it seems as though not everyone was aware of the parts and their location.
else	from the time I logged the call to the time the Lenovo engineer arrived, 2 weeks had passed with no updates from Lenovo so very disappointed with this aspect of the service. We are on a next working day service so 2 weeks is really not good at all
else	Lenove didn't even responded to my service request, how do you expect me to give you feedback
else	Better information on Email updates.The updates don't provide much in the way of info as to what is going on with the ticket.
else	We had to wait for 6 weeks for a repair
else	Please give 6-7 days to receive product....at present we having only 3 day
else	When requested by the caller, rep should speak louder and as clearly as possible. Some of us who have reached a certain age are hearing challenged.
else	Proper parts not sent by LENOVO
else	Make the phone support available 24x7.
else	Coordination of lenovo customer support needs more improvement .If customer gives a case I'd they should be informed with latest update
else	"The ""new"" phone has a problem with the hepatic feedback (buzz on the screen when you touch it) - sometimes it works, other times it just fades away. That's not how it should be. I'm thinking of returning it for another one."
else	Too many updates and not every app can be used on tablet.  Drawing on paper and surface of halo does work well.
else	Our call got disconnected once, thats really the only problem I had. The technician was fantastic.
else	ship parts quicker, there were several delays as multiple parts needed to be sent
else	Ship the correct part the first time.
else	I took Lenovo more than a week to reply to my message. I had some serious issues with my Lenovo yoga 720 (Chasis was bent, Loud fan noise).
else	Maybe I missed the option or phone support. I could only find chatting as an option. I would have preferred to call someone. It would be great if you could make that option more obvious.
else	You sent me back and forth between departments. I had to make several calls.
else	there was a lot of background noise  and talking
else	Provide a faster verall service (including delivery) - leaving customers with no laptiop for 12 days to fix a basic fault is very poor service.   It is really annoying when you can see the work has been completed by the parcel is being progressed in slow time through the UPS tracker.
else	No one has contacted me on what to do after I emailed by proof of purchase.
else	All the specification listed are not working properly....When I Tried contacting your lenevo service center.....No one is ready to help.....Wont recommend lenevo to anyone
else	Keep in contact with the customer when issues are being investigated
else	When i called not to be tranfer .
else	the replacement part failed in 3 days. Service tech was good.
else	It can be better if you guys send parts as backup. in similar complaint, we had to replace Motherboard. even thought informed to tech support, they will send engineer to check the issue then send the motherboard to fix it. I am completely unsatisfied with this policy.
else	Lenovo could be better at making sure the help people are a bit easier to reach, and to make sure they have their facts about parts correct(shipping specifcally).
else	Service centre guys were unprofessional they must hear opinion of customer before giving their judgement
else	replacement part was not fitted
else	They can reduce the time for delivery by spare parts planning in advance .
else	A faster repair turnaround,  eg drop off and pickup option. As is, mail in option require someone to be home for extended hours waitin5for courier, a day trapped
else	There was some online connectivity difficulty but I can't remember what it was; the result was that things were done by phone and then internet. The advice given worked. The problem was with Kaspersky Total Security which was blocking my webcam. Whilst Kaspersky is a very good programme, it has caused similar grief before. I have contacted them on both occasions but received no response. The response to my first problem was very unhelpful to say the least. I had WiFi problems - no signal more than a few meters from the router. The trouble was that for some reason on high-end laptop you used a single channel WiFi card 'n'. Tech support would not let me know what 'a-c' adapter was compatible (there is a white list problem here) but wanted me to send my machine in which would have been expensive and time consuming. By ferreting around I did manage to find an appropriate card and it works perfectly, but it did take a long time to resolve against a background of unhelpfulness.However my second service query was responded to promptly and correctly and everything works well so you have been at least partly forgiven!Chris Stagg
else	It took several attempts, several calls and create several tickets to get the call takers to write my address correctly. Also, the information I received about the part was confusing. The first communication said the part was on back order. After calling to inquiry on the expected time to get the part, I was informed that the part was available and on its way. I understood the part would be delivered to the technician who would work on the computer. Then I realized the part would be delivered to me. Mail is not delivered to my door, so I had to go somewhere else to get the part. Other than those inconveniences, the service was fast, the call takers were courteous, especially the last one I talked to, and the technician did a good job.
else	The communication is quite poor as we didn't receive any feedback as to what problems / issues were found.
else	Take the trouble to reply to correspondence.  Take responsibility for product failure.
else	Improved communication and updates on service status.  We had one technician book in the service and then change and hand over to a 2nd technician which meant we had to push back the on-site service.  Secondly, whilst one issue was repaired we ended up with 2 more issues from this service work - a damaged power on button and a failed battery.  This is plainly unacceptable and the time it has taken to resolve these issues is further unacceptable.
else	Better access to spare parts
else	I came to know that service engineers aren't provided with screws. Some of the screws in my laptop were missing and service engineer tried to conatct his seniors and customer support for the same but both of them denied providing screws. What if my laptop gets damaged again due to unavailability of screws whose fault will be that. Moreover I was frustrated calling your customer support again and again they were continuously denying my issue saying that travelling is an unsuitable operating environment. Please include travelling in your policies so that this doesn't happens again.And also please directly connect to the technical team rather than connecting it to customer suppprt team I can't explain the same issue to many people again and again.
else	Make product return quiker.
else	Make sure updates are bug free and don't corrupt the os
else	This issue is not resolved, no one called me back, i keep getting told to call sales support, sales tells me to call tech support. I'm just getting a run around. Please help. :)
else	It was somewhat difficult to understand Romeo on the phone. I had to ask him to repeat himself several times.
else	Proper service was not provided due to technical issues no idea if such kind of service is provided to the customer
else	Provide more updates on the services of the product.
else	"A couple of little points needed correction after the PC was returned. It was set up with a US rather than UK keyboard so the "" and @ were reversed and for some reason it was an hour out in its timezone (perhaps because Germany is an hour ahead of the UK. I am now using the PC running Windows 8.1 even though about 18 months ago I upgraded to Windows 10. Both times the hard disk failure occured after the latest Windows 10 update so I am not risking upgrading to Windows 10 again. However operating OneDrive under Windows 8.1 is less user friendly than under Windows 10."
else	good service call and schedules but poor resolution
Agent	Train the agents to avoid guessing.  Escalate quicker to more experienced agents.
else	Learn to be on time to appointments,
else	I made the claim on Friday and they were suppose to come out on Monday and never came. I called late in the afternoon and they came out the next day.
else	I don't know what has happened to the onsite service but we had problems getting parts on another call and it took 3 weeks.   So it appears the onsite service, and perhaps service in general, is broken.
else	Better response time
else	Laptop was sent to Lenovo and returned to me in WORSE operating condition
else	There is more time response and more formalities to  solve problems... .i replace my lcd in adp warranty...lenovo engineer replace  my lcd part by made in china products (local part)
else	My first telephone experience was horrible.  He was hard to understand and kept referring to me as sir, when I told him I was a female named Karen. I took this laptop to Best Buy as after trying several suggested things to fix the problem. I now am waiting on a box to send the laptop for repair. I could be without the laptop for up to nine business days. I am not happy.
else	Still waiting for manager to call me back
else	build your computers right the first time; reduce waiting time for technician
else	I shipped my phone 2 weeks ago, then after repair my phone was shipped to wrong address, so I called 3 times. First call the agent was rude, she promise me to call back in a few min, but never did. Finally, my phone was returned to sender yesterday and I didnt get any e-mail to update my info, so I have to call again. Hopefully my phone wont get lost. I always have had Motorola phones in my life, looks like its time to change the brand
else	None of the above, the technical was inflexible
else	Since making that call for that issue.  A new issue has arisen.  When I shut down my computer it, the white light stays on.  I open the laptap and it comes on without my pressing the power button.  I shutdown again and it finally goes off.
else	Less time between problem reporting and resolution. Every time I submit a ticket, I am notified that the part is on backorder. More parts should probably remain in stock.
else	Took very long time (two months) to complete the repair due to waiting for parts. The repair form said that it would take 9 days to complete.  That made the 2 months repair time unacceptable  It was difficult to check for repair status.  Very disappointed about Lenovo's service and quality of a $1000 Laptop which died in a month. Could that be Improved?
else	Provide support on time
else	Was never notified that you received the laptop.  Tried looking it up online but the ticket number didn't pull up anything.  Had to call in to check on it.  Was sent an email saying that the laptop was ready to ship out, and then received it that day.  Very bad communication.
else	Shorter wait time.
else	There was a lot of background noise in the phone conversation, so it was not easy to clearly understand one another
else	Improve repair times and policies
else	I don't get marsmello update
else	Send more than one part when the cause of the issue is not clear. Ensure parts are not damaged.
Agent	Lenovo Waranty Service has definitely improved in the past few months however I had multiple follow ups on the monitor I had already returned. My colleague had a similar experience. Need better tracking on the faulty equipment returns.
else	Pay for returning the computer to you since it was still under warranty
else	Initially the part order was not placed and the service request timed out after 3 days, and I got an email stating the case was closed on day 7, then had to call and start the process again. That was really upsetting. When the part order was placed with the second service request, the repair happened quickly. The service technician was excellent.
else	UPS attempted to deliver part to office at 10:20am (there were people definitely in the office then), but because he was unsuccessful, he left it at the nearest UPS Store. This caused confusion with the on-site technician. He came to the office --> left the office --> had to pickup the part from the UPS Store --> walk back to the office --> repair laptop keyboard
else	Unable to return product for replacement
else	Need gb with enough storage compatable with new updates
else	Better updates and ease of contact
else	make phone wait times shorter
else	Waiting for onsite engineer to call me back. This can take a week or so. Then another week for them to attend. Compare with dell. Usually next day.
else	Can you do much better by delivering the parts
else	"improve the product; purchased in feb 2017 it began failing in 6 months, causing hours of tech support on phone and ""solving"" one problem only to have another pop up... unreliability was extremely frustrating. then on a trip, it died completely and spent a month in repair, returned to me with new motherboard and hard drive, entailing many more hours with tech support to get it set up again. now can't hold internet long enough to finish a process... while ipad sitting beside it (I need back up for this Lenovo product and the ipad, at less than 1/2 price,and lighter) is reliable !00%"
else	It took 4 months from when I sent it in to when I received it. I Think it shouldn't have taken that long to service.
else	Complete repair faster
else	Better response on what the process is  from the initial contact and the follow up with Lenovo. The tech was appointed and has done a great job of following up but is stuck in between and could not help as he could have. Give more control to the local tech support delegated to resolve the issue
else	Producing a more durable unit with larger capacity would be helpful.  This computer is underpowered, something I was not aware of at the time of purchase.  Ultimately, I would be willing to pay more for a unit that could download essential Windows 10 updates (for example) without the need for an  external memory.  I had to use an external memory when the unit was returned and updates needed to be installed.
else	More updates and faster service
else	Was shipped a defective part but getting a working replacement was quick so things were fine overall
else	let the customer know when parts ship even if back ordered as in our case.  There was at least a 2 week delay of service due to parts not being shipped
else	slow services & respond, technician did not come on time keep reschedule.
else	I have not been updated on the status or outcome of my laptop
else	first point of contact should be lenovo and not flipkart or other third party services
else	Quicker turnaround and making sure the language settings match the settings received as
else	Currently T460s in my company are having issues with Lenovo's update which damages the Intel SSD.
else	slow...  still waiting
else	Better communication on status ...   my PC was reported not received at one point...
else	You keep sending broken parts.
else	A lame person is not having enough knowledge of hardware. The service support assistant shall not ask the lame person to check the hardware, this may also result in major fault....... due to lapse
else	On my opinion Lenovo team designing models very quite impressive but Lenovo services will be getting very slow Lenovo promising on my Lenovo k8 note giving monthly security updates but it's too delay taking much time
else	My Laptop issue resolved after 10 days,  so It is very pathetic condition of issue resolution .
else	We had to return the laptop twice the first time the problem was less severe for awhile but eventually returned.  Not sure if a more thorough check the first time would have resolved the issue sooner.
else	I received a USB to resolve the issues of my laptop running extremely slow, updates not updating and the laptop saying the memory is full and we have no new applications downloaded, music, photos etc. The USB  did not work. I am left to send the laptop back to get repaired.
else	The first round of support took more than 4 months with no updates on why it was taking so long or what was wrong.  When the computer was returned there was no information that accompanied it so I still didn't know what was wrong and I couldn't log in. The second return was quicker, but the packaging for the return also came without clear instructions.
else	The software they updated was not the latest  one
else	On two occasions I had service work done and both times Lenovo sent the wrong parts initially. The service rep was great, but he had to return a second time to install the correct part once I received it
else	Lenovo representative couldnt fix problem and promised to call back after weekend but then failed to honour this promise. Issue is still unresolved.
else	Have parts more readily available, quicker response, engineer to give an exact time of arrival at least 1 day before.
else	Our address was taken wrongly and because of it, one day was delayed each way, picking up and returning it.
else	Provide the packaging when returning goods as customers do not keep th original packaging
else	Instead of 1 person in charge, there are 2 who call at different times few times and making appointments to fix my laptop.
else	I guess get the correct parts to the tech.
else	Send the parts to the customer address for self installation
else	More detailed instructions with troubleshooting guide for thunderbolt Docks. Make support for Thunderbolt docks easier to find and obtain.
else	Less hold time on the phone
else	Deliver the right stuff and avoid us to loose hours to try to send the one we got back and wait forever to receive what we ordered!
else	Don't send 2 technicians to service a product when the parts can be sent and replace by the IT department at the location.  This is a huge waste of your resources and causes the price I pay for your products to be higher.
else	Pay for the return shipping. These are still under warranty and I have had to send 11 of 100 back for some type of repair or update.
else	Keep the customer updated with what is happening. I had to call your contact centre about 5 times and didn't get a call back. The guy who visited onsite was excellent but your back office support was very poor!
else	HAve parts shipped faster and stock more of the necessary parts
else	Speeding up the process for  returning items.
else	PROBLEM STILL NOT RESOLVED AND COMPUTER UNUSABLE after nearly 4 weeks AND WITH 2 DAY ONSITE SERVICE PURCHASEDNumerous calls to support and given contradictory information. Impossible to talk to anybody about formal complaint. Nobody can make decision to replace under warranty. Lenovo cost so far in sending technician (with faulty replacement) is circa 450. You are waiting for another replacement part, and another 450 to fit.WHEN WILL YOU TAKE MY CASE SERIOUSLY?IM NOW TAKING LEGAL ADVICE
else	Pass on the feedback to the end team member to motivate them
else	If I tell you I have received my replacement phone, stop asking me to verify my email and mailing address instead of answering my question!And if you want me to reset my phone to factory settings, you need to give me instructions on how to do it!
else	The part took along time to get on-site over 2 weeks before the engineer turned up to fit the new keyboard.
else	lenovo didn't provide us replaced part number , which sent by your service Engg.
else	Repair status was never updated so I was not notified that my laptop had been receivied. My charger was not included with the laptop when it was returned to me after being repaired.
else	Be in contact with the customer when you say you will be. Provide them updates. ANYTHING other than just radio silence especially if you have had their machine for a whopping THREE MONTHS.
else	Issue was not fixed, tech was out multiple times, kept saying he was sent the wrong part.  He cracked the screen the first time he was here, and made it worse with each visit.
else	Give service on time. And make sure that your commitment to the customer will be fulfilled on time.
else	Improve on technical issues.
else	Do service then take feedback
else	I was returned the wrong laptop! Service centre did not check my laptop properly and returned the wrong laptop to me.
Agent	Need send the follow up email with transcript of the discussion.
else	The resolution time would been reduced instead of several visits by the Tech person.
else	Make contact info easier to find
else	still waiting on parts because the Lenovo Repair Depot damaged my device during their attempt to repair 1st time
else	deliver key parts in timely manner
else	Ship the items back in the same condition as the leave. My computer sustained damages due to poor packaging on return shipment. I called and reported this and No One has called or emailed me back about fixing it.
else	Respond timely to customers requests, stop putting them on hold for minutes, give a call back for updates.
else	Make a charger that doesnt snap like a twig and better support for a three month old laptop.
else	Please check the parts before sending it for any replacement. My laptop parts have been replaced 3 times and all three times part was faulty. Well it costs time. And that needs to be improved.
else	Your Czech repair department steadfastly accused me of damaging the screen which I did not. The screen was in a worse condition when it got to them compared to when it left the uk.Move the repair centre to the uk.
else	Provide emails updates on when a engineer is visiting
else	update customer with progress
else	More communication about delays, and a more timely resolution
else	Informed and Inspired representatives , functional tracking system and better workmanship
else	i didn't receive my box (for depot service) at the first attempt. It took me one week to realize that my box will never arrive and then I called you to send a new box. The new one arrived in only 2 days.
else	Visiting engineer highly unprofessional
else	More technically informed phone support reps.
Agent	train agents to actually ty to help instead of read from a script
else	shorter time to deliver the part, replace the part and pickup the faulty part would help.
else	Technician did not receive all parts/correct parts from Lenovo. I was impressed with Lenovo's overnight shipping.
else	In this case, the part was not readily available in Lenovo stock.  So I had to wait for several days before part shipped.
else	it is not acceptable to have a PC fixed 4 times until it was done / fixed.
else	my first attempt at placing a service request failed as the system said it was out of warranty even though the unit is new.  had to close and open a new ticket to resolve since no one was responding to my requests for status updates.
else	Improve returning courier service. Laptop was left at screen door while no ATL was given. Courier also left card saying it had been returned to depot!
else	Better you can reduce the lead time for part replacement/solution giving time.
else	warranty not updated. it took 2 month from service center. i only personally followed up to get the warranty details updated in the lenovo system database through customer care.
else	Do what I asked to have done. :)  I asked about the way the computer clicks and doesn't always respond to what I clicked for.  Nothing changed thought there was lots of activity to correct. No discussion about whether it was solved or not.
else	Your customer service is horrible (especially sales, the guy was so rude, unprofessional and not helpful at all!) , I was being transferred endlessly for hours and still could not find any help, I wish I read about that before I bought my computer from you. I had to contact support via your Facebook page thank God for the kind gentleman handling the page.
else	provide updates
else	When I first call the Lenovo technical support help lines, I frequently got disconnected. The customer service representative simply hung up on me three times!
else	Build quality, the t480 is a nicely specced machine, but the build is weak I'm many areas. In particular the monitor and keyboard touch.my monitor is now heavily marked and scratched after 8 months of use.
else	Upon the replacement of motherboard, serial number is not updated and resolved n 2nd attempt.
else	The person I spoke with in the customer service department was extremely rude. They barely spoke up and were difficult to understand and they shut me down from asking a question and rushed me on the phone and were really terrible. They need training to be nicer to the customer.
else	I never received any information about what went wrong and how to avoid it happening again.
else	Speedier return of laptop (although I appreciate it was over the Christmas period).
else	First case was closed after the parts were on backorder. Had to call and open a new case.  Then the parts arrived but I never heard from a tech and had to call again.  Overall it took nearly a month to fix which is way too long.
else	Ensure the process to send out the return box is smoother. I had to have 2 requests cancelled.
else	The problems I had reported, were not on the form I got back detailing the issues reported. I had reported that the trackpad was faulty, the battery drained too fast under light loads, and that the processing speed was slow for what it was. The trackpad was not mentioned in the report, nor was the processing issues. Furthermore, whoever worked on the laptop left several large scratch-marks on the underneath, and the laptop appears to reject connections to WiFi sources that I had no trouble accessing previously; I need to be able to connect to my college's internet, otherwise, I am isolated from the internet.
else	Have parts on hand and send more parts with the tech
else	Send parts out quickly
else	I didn't get any updates about my laptop. So send updates
else	less waiting time on Support phone
else	The techs need to be faster at calling and booking repairs with clients.  Its ridiculous to have to call multiple times to get a tech out for repairs on company product.
else	actual offer a solution, my product was not fixed on phone. I was told to return it for another. To find out this is a common problem with your product. So resolution at all would have been better
else	improve customer support - allow faster turn around time
else	Lap top was sent to Germany but upon return there are new problems
else	I was sent back a phone without a back or battery and was told that I would receive back and Battery within 24 do I want to say 48 hours and still have not received it
else	Have received an empty box
else	Oreo update
else	Critical Updates were turned off on my PC to prevent BIOS updates from bricking my laptop. This does not resolve the issue. Do a follow up with the customer when your issues are resolved.
else	Ensure replacement parts are high quality.
else	The phone reps weren't as knowledgeable as they have been in the past.  It's like I could feel your support is brand new over the phone.  I had three or four phone reps and only one was super knowledgeable.  She finally got me the help I needed (props to her).  the others were... weak.  Also, your BIOS used to always display what kind of hard drive is present on the machine... the laptop model i had with updated BIOS doesn't show storage present... if you go to diagnostics with a broken storage device (not detecting) there ARE no diagnostics to find a failed drive - so you're supposed to know it's bad if storage diagnostics are not there.  That kind of sucks.  The onsite consultant that came to fix the problem was AMAZING - he fixed it first time and was super fast.  Love that guy.
else	The first technician could not fix the device/ the second technician arrived, when the laptop was fixed, after he left realized one component was missing so the device no longer worked/ rang engineer and he did not have the part, he had to come a second time/ customer does not required of a call, only to take the feedback stated here.
else	Better quality control of replacement parts
else	Low professionalism of first level customer service person
else	To be specific, my tablet was freezing every time it tried to do a system update which it did automatically. I sent my tablet to yourselves to be fixed and it was sent back. The same day I tried to do system update and it froze again.  Once more you took my tablet and sent it back fine. Couple of days later my tablet tried to automatically update system and it froze again. I called up once more and was told even though my warranty had expired that they would fix.  After I put the phone down I received an email to say that if I wanted my tablet to be fixed I would have to pay. I was upset and am unwilling to pay
else	provide timely updates when there will be a delay
else	My laptop was rendered completely useless after the installation of the parts. RMS/Transport IT have not been able to re-image it and have now requested a replacement asset be provided.
else	faster process in general... took over a week to fix the problem.Thankfully it was an issue that did not render the machine unusable, but if I get a serious problem that disables my machine... am I supposed to not work for a couple of weeks till parts arrive and come over?
else	The speed was slower than desired but I only received any updates on the status of our repair when I requested them: I was kept rather out of the loop unless I chased for an update.
else	When there is a defective part, please arrange the replacement part to be delivered along with the Technician within in 2 working days
else	Ensure that customers will have updates readily available and that communications will not be completely cut off between the service center and customer support/ the customer
else	Plz improve Ur warranty policy also customer care support and we'll educated product knowledge of the laptop tools also products
else	Improve follow up tracking system and seek customer feedback before closing the case. Actually it takes several traces to get the quotation in place.
else	Lenovo can increase the technical support receptionist..
else	Answer the phone a little quicker
else	better contacto
else	Give an estimate on back-ordered part availability.
else	This is not the first time that the phone support sent the wrong part - get it right the first time
else	more feedback on issue when computer returned to me. Hard drive replaced it says. Computer is slow at times and locks up.
else	First, don't try to be cheeky and send second hand parts.  You got caught out.
else	Camera has still problems in focusing on targets and resolution changes when taking pictures in dim light.The pictures improved in daylight conditions and when shot in close distances, but when in 4x or 8x mode, the camera loses totally where to focus on.The camera has no stabilizer, I know, but that seems not to be the problem.The same camera in a Samsung and Apple shoots clear pictures.
else	Not distribute faulty units
else	Better response with sending ups labels for product return.
else	Communicate to customer on the status before he reaches out to you for an update
else	Make warranty update much, much easier
else	Faster response time,
else	first, it took too much time to receive and even now I can not go to windows because it needs a security code. I called but the admin just sent me pdf. I wanted to talk to the supervisor but the admin told me he is busy! I want someone help me to use my laptop!
else	Sort out a better courier for returns, I would suggest using parcelforce
else	Please Send part on time...or fast because from lenovo These taking to much time to send the part its effect on Daily work... Customer can not wait more 15 days for part.
else	lergion series laptop needs better cooling for cpu/processor and all drivers should be installed at the factory already, or this service call would not be needed
else	When an order is called in and a part is missing, do not forget about the client.
else	The instructions for returning the computer were confusing. It asked that the unit not be shipped with the battery.
else	fix problem first time (cooling fan both times in 2 months)
else	It would be better if you can also update your clients through their mobile number, just so the communication would be faster. I actually had to call them first before I was informed that my laptop is already available for pick-up.
else	I was referred to a local telephone number, which no one picked up
else	Poor sales team, still waiting for my invoice to be emailed
else	Too much background noise. I could not hear the tech. The tech could not hear me. I screamed in the phone and finally hung up. The tech called back. Problem was resolved.
Agent	Very slow follow up. we had reported the battery  USB charger was damaged , as  we did not  open up & the lap top only  after  several days.   However as today , we still have not received  the replacement
else	Accourding to my order I was nsuppose to get  LENOVO V110-171KB -Core I5-7200.I received a Lenovo V320-17 lKb  Core I5 .  I called , they said Amazon forget to update the numbers on there list.I look at the back nof notebook and the mfgDate is 18/02/07 and you sell it as a new machine. That is really hard to understand.  849,00 Eurs is a lot of money for old products.
else	Keep me better informed about repair progress and likely timescale
else	on my first call for service, the Lenono rep told me I had a software problem and referred me to microsoft. When mocrosoft dodn't respond I called Lenova help line again and rhis time the rep directed me to restart the laptop in a novel way using a bent paper clip and then, working under the rep's direction I was able to get up and running.My ratings on this survey are a combination of frustration with the first rep and satisfaction with the second.
else	Improve delivery of parts
else	I wont suggest anyone to go for Lenovo it was my worst experience I logged the complain related to beep sound but the technical person recommended me a keyboard replace.
else	React faster, I have been waiting for the spare part now for 10 ays, and I haven,t get it yet
else	I found it quite difficult to find the number that I needed to call for help
else	The product was returned to me after being a the depot, in the same unusable condition.  I have sent it back under a new case and have yet to receive back (Feb 19th, 2019).
else	Quicker parts
Agent	The customer service agent was extremely difficult to understand, my problem was not fixed and troubleshooting was infuriating and lacked any technical expertise.
else	Faster engineer call outs! we logged two calls in total, one a few months back which took over 5 weeks to resolve and then another (after the 'improvements' were made) which took 3 weeks before a tech came out! This is with premiere support which we though was something like a 1-3 day turn around, so thats quite far off the mark. The actual call to your Service Desk was fine, that i can tell has improved the tech on the phone was great. So the only issue we have is with your field technician call out times - which is of course pretty important.
else	The phone connection was a little poor, there seemed to be a delay so we found ourselves accidentally talking over each other.  I don't know if the poor connection was on my end or yours.  This was definitely not the technician's fault though - he was very patient and helpful.
else	Didn't wait for long to receive my mobile.
else	Reduce time taken for parts to be available for replacement
else	I submitted my support request by email, and the response from Lenovo was slow (took 2 days). The response provided no information at all on what I needed to do to resolve my problem. The response merely asked me to return my machine - which was utterly unnecessary. I managed to fix the problem myself, with no help at all from Lenovo.
else	I have a phone that does not work well, I guess making better phones
Agent	Just to add -- I appreciated the fact that the agents were in Atlanta (state-side) -- that was very welcome!!   I also want to add that they were personable, pleasant, informative, and did the best they could (the 2 agents I spoke with were Steve (perhaps last name Falk - because of email) and the second was Tommy.
else	pay for return if still under warrant. both ways
else	Send parts that are not defective!!
else	Better communication when the first part arrived, the email gave the impression I was supposed to fit the part.
else	I've been transferred to every department known to man. Everyone says it's not their department.
else	Was not given any advice on how to connect to wifi by hotspoting my phone to connect the two.
else	Have better options for dealing with a broken product than making customers wait weeks with a broken computer
else	If you were updated, I had cancelled my appointment because I managed to get it going
else	It was unclear that the parts were not getting sent to us and rather to the technician they were sending out to fix the issue.
else	Depot Repair representatives could be better, more professional.
else	1. Send the correct box to ship the unit in, 2. Pack it properly for the return and 3. ACTUALLY FIX THE COMPUTER
else	No longer supported device, confirmed android version for my region and vendor, unable to update to latest version as stated on website.
else	Some of the parts in the laptop like hinges are loose and the Engineer said it was broken from inside but it was not a physical damage so I would request you to plss replace the hindges
else	Very rude behavior of staffs and they have less knowledge about services.They made a compulsory upgradation of mobile software even I was not ready for upgradation.
else	read emails and respond
else	Provide better updates on open support cases.
else	Shorter wait time and more knowledge support staff.
else	Faster repair times. Laptop under repair, no laptop for work.
else	I sent a watch in that is in pristine condition. The one I received has scratches and while battery life is improved with this replacement watch, it appears this watch already has a somewhat degraded battery, only lasting 10-12 hours.
else	Know what they are doing and which part the computer actually needs
else	regional takes longer 1 week and order a part was an inconvenience with no laptop to work with
else	Speed, communication, professionalism, not taking the customer for an idiot. all of it needs improvement
else	The device was waiting for a part for 2 months. There was no meaningful estimate for the part, I was referred to different ph
else	telephone support was no existant . where not able to get thru was on hold with nothing to indicate wait time. i ended up going on line
else	Fedx delivered it to the wrong house and then when i found it the next day it was the wrong part. I needed the plug that goes into the laptop but was sent the plug that goes into the wall.
else	Teach your technical support manners, teach them empathy, teach them to not hang up phones. Teach your dispute management team to respond to customers.
else	My charger was not returned. I just opened the package today after I returned from the holidays!
else	after replace my parts I have facing some issue like hanging &v some time my mouse is not work. same has been convey with your executive to call me for the feedback
else	Too long to have the replacement divece received
else	I originally submitted the service request via the site linked at Lenovo leading me to https://www.managedtechnicalsupportaccess.com/mtsarva/lenovo.htmlThis site is terrible, half of the time when entering my details I got 404s, it's unresponsive and hard to navigate. It looks so cheesy I at first thought I was on a phishing site.Once I switched over to phone support everything went smoothly. But this site, man, please drop it. Seriously.
else	Hope can improve the speed of replacement part order from overseas
else	monitor the likes of Microsoft updates and plan Lenovo upgrades to faciltate.
else	Re: Service Request#:406B7T2 , Product:20F9, Serial#:PC0BF3VY.Service request was cancelled without my knowledge. I had to call to be informed it was cancelled.
else	Still waiting for instructions or explanations.
else	Get better parts
else	Delay in parts avaibility & delivery
else	Advance replacement when parts are bock ordered or unavailable
else	Device was sent in because it would not turn on the trackpad was not not working. When it was returned it woul not connect to the network and to be sent back again.
else	The technician was not sure of how to update BIOS and it appeared the system board was bad. He had to order a new system board, once he installed the new system board he was receiving the same codes as he did after installing the new AUX Fan. He had to call support for assistance and mentioned to the other person on the phone he was unaware of this setting in BIOS.
else	Make the call center faster/easier to navigate to get to the right department. Don't try to upsell service programs I don't need or want but feel pressured to buy because your phone rep said buying the SW support pkg was the only way for me to get help with my problem.
else	If the question is regarding the telephone support I received from Lenovo then I would score highly satisfied however if it is about the tech support from BestBuy then I will have to say they are extremely slow as it has been almost 2 weeks and the GeekSquad portal indicates that they just received a part and I have no idea how much longer they will have my laptop.
else	Please reply on time at earliest
else	they took almost 5 days to just check that they can not resolve the issue with software update.Even after taking 5 days they are saying they need to replace the hardware, when it can be resolved just with the software formatting.
else	Computer was returned to me with the administrator still logged into the computer. This company is garbage and so is their service.
else	not applicable as I have not received my phone yet
else	Fix the problem with new parts - not used parts?
else	I sent my laptop back three times for repair and three times it came back unresolved. The same issue was present as soon as I tested it. Lenovo staff had noted that it had been fixed. I don't think they even looked at it.
else	Better explanation as to which parts we were waiting on.
else	Pack the returned product properly (IE. not upside down, where scratches can occur) Ensure the computer is put back together properly, by making sure all the bezels are all the way down. Be more careful in the handling of the product so as not to add scratches.
else	the replacement part does not fit in to the laptop, it stuck on the LAN port, but how ever support team do resend another part and it manage to fit in the laptop.
else	I missed the first chat because I switched windows and lost track of time. A sounded alert or notification wouldve been helpful.
else	Non professionals are dealing. Simply making no logic arguments. My case I have spent 1300 rupees . Problem still persist. Hopeless service. While giving the handset at morning 2 customers are shouting at reception. Same time I felt that service centre is hopeless. After the job once again confirmed the same.
else	When the computer returned we had an issue with it shutting down.  We called to get help and were told that we needed to pay a support service fee.  We have no idea if you ever fixed the computer because we cannot even get support to troubleshoot the problem we are now experiencing.
else	I like the products but the initial email response to my assistance request was slow and not followed up when it did not work.
else	LAst 6 month issue not resolve also technical support team not respond properly
else	Need more professional people at the service center
else	stop the junk mail after several fallow up i am receiving mail as i requested earlier this mail should not be come to my inbox and i am not aware about case logs.
else	having the inside support work better with the outside support and making sure the onsite persons respond and pickup their parts ontime
else	We have sent this computer two times to Lenovo service center in two months of time and came back without repair.Service could not discover what the problem was. We are absolutely not satisfied with result anyway. computer is reinstalled with default Lenovo OS image but problem remains. when you hold this computer from the corners of the keyboard side screen flickers and does strange stuff. Also time to time same symptoms happen while user types a document his hands on the keyboard and also we hear electrical short circuit noises from keyboard!  We need this computer to be repaired or replaced with a decent one. Already we are not able to use this one properly for about three months.
else	Do not email requesting details that are already logged in the call as this just delays the resolution. Hold more stock of SSD's
else	Laptop was returned when problem was still there.
else	Provide case updates on email.
else	Please get someone to contact me so I can return the damaged hard drive.  I was told I'd be charged for it if I didn't, but haven't been given any information on how to return it.
else	Be better at communication.I had to return back from the centre once due to their misinformation to me regarding delivery of my laptop.
else	Improve communication with 3rd party freight companies regarding consignment note issuing.Improve communication of jobs with contractors.
else	tried calling back and unable to reach
Agent	I was placed on hold and not offered any assistance with my problem. I asked for a supervisor and was told there was not one . When I got upset and questioned the specialist , O was told the supervisor was on the phone and would call me back . I made sure I gave my home number and cell number . To date I have not received a call back . This computer is under warranty and I was told I had s software problem before I even said what the problem was . The warrenty only covers hardware.This was the 5 th computer I bought from HSN and I have never had a problem. This my first Lenovo and I am beyond upset at the lack of customer service.
else	Please provide the right part: the replacement keyboard is different from the original keyboard. (This case is about a broken cable due to an attempt to fix the finger printer reader.)
else	I contacted MOTOROLA on April 19, 2018 re: Phone would not charge; I sent MOTOROLA-4, via FEDEX and did not receive all proper pieces back, to complete RMA process. As of today (5/72018), I am awaiting remaining pieces to Motorola - 4  (i.e. The back cover of smart phone & phone battery).Sincerely,Angela McRae(407) 271-6626
else	i went to motorola service center hoping there will be some repair work done to my mobile and get it in working condition . However, other than telling me to buy a new phone instead of servicing the existing phone . They returned my mobile phone not in working condition and also took service charges for no reason at all. If i am supposed to get my not working mobile in a not-working condition why should i be charged?
else	Faster service, easier to use and more frequently updated status page
else	Make sure ALL parts requested are delivered.
else	This is not for this case, but just a feedback. There should be proper compilation before your technician visit the site. Technicians do multiple visits for similar issues.
else	need experience technical support for Lenovo concern to make sure that specific hardware problem.
else	Send the correct part next time. Also when going back to report this issue via chat I waited 20 minutes just for the support rep to leave the chat immediately without even saying anything.Isaiah BrowningChatting with Isaiah Browning.12:39 PM:: Isaiah Browning has left the chat ::12:40 PMRidiculous, and a waste of my time.
else	by improving the mail updates collection information by ups
else	Replace with original parts and not substandard parts
else	Use dedicated Lenovo staff and not third party staff, who weren't quite sure what they were called out ?
else	stop sending rubbish parts and improve the time it takes to receive the parts
else	Procedure for acknowledgement of problem.
else	My laptop was returned with cosmetic damage from dissembling the unit improperly.
else	Rang on support number and dropped out after lengthy wait.  I then tried online chat to get my query sorted.
else	I submitted this request and since he initial e-mail to confirm the problem had been logged, I received no contact from Lenovo.  I then find out the server request has been closed and the problem has not been resolved.  I have now had to re-submit the service request again under reference # 8010394856
else	I'm still waiting for them to return the old hard drive to me for data recovery. I called and they said they would do it...
else	Improvements required in resolution
else	I like the unit, but encountered a problem where it wouldn't communicate with the monitor. Had to send in twice to finally get the problem resolved. Didn't receive information as to what exactly was don to resolve the issue. During the first send-in they changed the mother board. I have no idea what they did on the second send-in. There wasn't really any explanation as to what was changed, repaired, etc. The first send-in cost me $32. and thankfully the second was covered.
else	Get replacement parts faster
else	because the wrong part was ordered
else	still waiting for part and onsite. Part was sent but tech did not show
else	My phone's battery was draining very fast so I asked them to helpl me they said that they will update my software and problem will be solved but after visiting service center it has started to drain faster.
else	at times had trouble understanding accent and instructions over phone so better communication at times
else	Not charge us next day business support and still let it take over two months to reach a resolution. The constant pushing back of our maintenance was also very frustrating.
else	Takes a long time for the parts to get to the technician.  The tech did a fine job when he got here.
else	Have a customer service representatives call back when requested
else	First time keyboard defect, change keyboard, but never glue properly, second time return to glue, came off again, third time send in and re-glue, diagnose my speaker problem, wait one month for part, still need to call in to ask laptop status. now back to square one, keyboard came off again.
else	When the PC has an anomaly that causes it to sit in holding for 3 days, please call and let me know; not just update the status in the portal and wait for me to call in.
else	Faster turn around on parts and engineer visits
else	Re open this call and fix it
else	Resolve the issue end to end without having the customer to chase the company for different parts.
else	Better product knowledge. L1 should have know th video card support prior to dispatching a Tech to replace a system board. The Lenovo PSREF guide gave me the info needed.
else	the screws on the bottom were not tightened when i received it and it took longer than expected
else	send the shipping labels as agreed first time, look at their own systems and not try to charge when ADI has been paid for and confirmed with Lenovo at the start of the process. Make sure contact staff can speak the language of the person they are talking to especially when talking about money.
else	Make sure device return without damage
else	louder volume on Lenovo end of the call.
else	Jimmy Johns delivery with replacement part
else	Was told they would not return it.
else	Timeliness - there was quite a long wait because the service company didnt have all the parts necessary.
else	Phone returned has speaker blown out. It is crackly and doesn't sound good.
else	update the customer with information, take the information correctly, speed up the service
else	faster shipping and repair.
else	"The waiting period between the time that i call and the time that i receive the box is a waste and a hindrance for my students. If i had shipping boxes on sight i could ship the device out the day i call for service instead of having to wait 3""business days"" for an empty box to be shipped to me. <~~ fix this. Send me a box of empty boxes so that the downtime for my students is shorter."
else	Thank you for your help in resolving this case. As we have discussed on the phone on April 26, this is my third attempt to get the device fixed, after it was previously mailed back to me in error (without any inspection that would have resolved the issue). As you may also recall from our conversation, the device has been shipped now three times, and I have had numerous phone conversations with support staff, as documented in the following service requests:  1)405LP5T, 2)405PTK6, 3)405ZFSV, 4)40647VR.  These service requests span over a month now, a long time frame during which I could not use the machine to its full extent. Even when I did get back the device the first time after the battery replacement, I had to spend significant amounts of time on re-installing the operating system, because only 50% of the hard disk was usable (due to a partition imaging error upon return from depot). In addition, I have spent now a combined 4 hours on the phone to resolve these issues, and the lack of common courtesy to at least return my calls execrated the situation.
else	Fix the problem I have, which still continues weeks after I called.
else	Respond to the problem much faster than a week - By the time you contacted me, I already had a replacement laptop from my company
else	Listen to what the customer explains what is wrong with the unit. I attached a VERY detailed description of the error and what needed to be done, but it seems the repair center completely ignored it.Also it would be great if you stopped manufacturing and selling computers with so small storage space that it's not enough to run the operating system sold with the computer, and its updates. I find it very deceptive and unprofessional to sell a computer with hardware insufficient to run its included operating system.
else	Use better quality parts
else	First of all you have only 2 centers in bangalore which is a IT hub. Then, You call the customer 2 times in your office. First, to receive the product and diagnose it and the person diagnosed it in front of me and concluded that the charger is faulty and needs to be replaced. Then, I have to come again some other day to collect the charger. I am a working person and you made me travel 7 kms 2 times. I asked if you can deliver at my address, that also you cannot do. This kind of service is not expected even after paying extra money.
else	better access through the phone.
else	have a tech that doesn't just transfer the call or tell me to call microsoft
else	the stylus pen was not returned.
else	make  it so that when a exspensive product you sell needs a reset  it does do that instead of asking me to send it to you so you can charge me to reset the stupid thing
else	A tech came to replace the hard drive and motherboard but the wrong motherboard was delivered.  The tech came back to finish the repair which all worked out fine though.
else	provide a shipping label
else	The quicker u can get parts before onsite service the better. in case of an emergency someone might need it in 3 days so depending on the urgency of the onsite request parts should be delivered accordingly.
else	faster response time for repair.  your technician is overbooked.
else	I was given no updates during the whole process. I had to call on multiple occasions and no one was able to give me any real answer. I was told over and over again that someone would get back to me, but no one ever followed up.
else	The process went as stated on the website for warranty returns, except that we read FedEx provided the packaging for free, which was not true. We paid ~$10.
else	Make contacting support easier or at least some behind the scenes communication/transition between standard business support and premier - had to explain the situation twice as there was no hand-off of tickets between support groups.
else	Problem was not resolved and moreover the laptop was returned with camera hardware failure
else	improve communication with the parts return department
else	i asked about windows update disable option.... still it's not disabled ....system is running very slow... in background updating is going on.... gpedit.msc option is not working.
else	Extreme wait time and then the person did not speak English well enough I had to repeatedly ask them to repeat what they were saying.
else	Device return with damage and missing part
Agent	Stop the terrible music while on hold.
else	Difficult to locate contact phone number for premier support services; long delivery time for requested media; long response time from support; and note enough status/action updates.
else	Shorter way trhu  the call center
else	Faster return of replacement monitor 4 weeks is a long time in process.
else	Respond of the customer service personal and how fast we received the phone back.
else	Just keep it up the onsite engineer on time.. :-)
else	My computer was scratched on top cover when I received my product
Agent	cut the hold time, if possible
Agent	The email had indicated that I would need to send my pc to Lenovo, and that they would arrange to collect it. This did not happen, and I had to follow up. After speaking to a technician twice I was able to resolve the issue over the phone
else	No engineer or parts ever turned up.
else	Service engineers are not trained well they damaging the sensitive part of the laptops.
else	To improve the quality of the product and  QC check on the parts of the computer.
else	The problem is not rectified they jus installed software again and gave back the mobile.They are even not ready to take feedback saying there is no feedback form
else	Improve the managedtechnicalsupportaccess.com website, it is shockingly poor and seems to require a password reset every time we re-visit it. It also has a massive url, couldn't you have used something shorter?
else	Pls ensure to return in a specified time
else	Try to update regularly from service center, and keep discussing about the difficulties in the product
else	The Original Document reads the wrong information saying the item would be returned ( Implying it would be back in say 2/3 days) but should read will be collected in 2/3 days for shipment to Germany
else	Improve the laptop cover so the parts inside will not be affected.
else	It took a very long time (over a month) from the time my suppler submitted the service request to the time the service Rep actually came onsite.  That was frustrating  more prompt attention would help.
else	use RMA shipping labels instead of requiring the customer to pay for shipping.  The Issue is not resolved.  However i am not paying another $30+ to send the laptop back, Again
else	Engineer had not replace the part
else	Reimburse shipping or offer shipping labels on warranty items.
else	My computer was returned with a non functioning biometric scanner. I have opened another ticket.
else	Shorter or no wait times during the calls, and a technically more savvy staff
else	better knowledge of problem om initial phone call
else	Make it respond more quickly. More memory would be nice.
else	Fix the issue I called about, still not resolved.
else	Take care of the issue instead of having me call different departments in support and those departments not knowing what to do but tell me to call another number.
else	Poor part quality (LCD display) is what caused you to miss the SLA in this case.  The service tech came out twice with replacement parts that were worse than the one being replaced, forcing the ThinkPad to be sent to the depot, where it was ultimately fixed.  Better quality of the LCD screen is needed.
else	Test the machine before returning to the customer
else	The communication emails were somewhat confusing, in that I received a generic confirmation email, followed by a notification that a part had been shipped from China. As this was a service request rather than a part request, some clarification would have been useful that this was something shipped to the technician rather than our office, and that the technician would come after the part (the mainboard) had arrived. It would also be beneficial to include our address and phone number in the scheduling email, just to ensure that the technician is going to the correct location. The service itself was good.
else	When you send out an update to the computer, give better advise or support in the installation
else	Look at my chats and calls and eliminate the need for them.
else	Difficult to say but shipment of parts was a mess.  We got parts intended for others and at times, our parts went elsewhere.
else	For on-site service, there seems to be a disconnect between the time a ticket is opened and the time an actual field technician contacts the customer to confirm service date.  In this case, we received the parts within a day or two, but didn't hear from the tech for several days...
else	The part needed was not available initially. A periodic status update would have been appreciated.
else	I am still waiting for answers back from Argos store where I bought the Tablet it was the only place I could get my Tablet looked at to get repaired with all the problems with the Tablet
else	Use a faster delivery system to get products repaired quicker
else	Teach your phone representatives courtesy and technical information.  Seriously, my rep had neither.
else	Train customer service in basic IT knowledge.
else	The replacement I received did not work correctly. It just turned off after about 3 hours. When I called I was told I would need another 400 deposit even though the tracking showed the phone I was replacing would be at the warehouse the following day. I had to get upset and speak to about 5 people. I was told another phone would be overnighted due to the fact the I was without a phone and that is my only means of communication and I operate a business and have children.
else	I am unable to comment, because I haven't had my unit.
else	Carry spare parts
else	Can be more clear about contact details of the concerned department.
else	Keep track of my device.
else	Too slow, Took more than one month to repair
else	The answer, that there is no supportet USB C charger is NOT acceptable!
else	My laptop 8 months old and all parts are changes...After Warranty what i do..
else	Show up and call
else	Ensure adequite personnel are available to meet customer demand and response SLAs
else	See if we can told the problem they are not ready to accept simply blame to third-party software vendors
else	I filed my ticket in December, but received no notification that a RMA box was shipped to my workplace. Because it wasn't addressed to me personally, the box was lying around in the office for over two weeks before I took notice of it and realized what it was. I started receiving correspondence after I sent the defective machine.
else	The first part arrived was faulty n 2nd order ETD was almost a month later
else	More timely status updates via email would be good. I had to log-in to the online system several times a day to see updates, even though the system indicated it was sending me an email. It would also be good to know when a part is being shipped directly to me instead of the service technician -- a package got refused by our building because we had no idea to expect it. The notes in the online system just indicated that a part had been shipped and provided the tracking number, but didn't indicate the recipient.
else	Better feedback
else	Explain from a technical standpoint why a brand new computer is has a serious error after recommended system updates.
else	Stop working with ServiceNet... very slow response time, taking ages to fix something. 2 months for docking station, awful.IBM Lietuva - FTW!
else	Actually send the parts and the engineers to replace the machines when you say you will.
else	assure the qualities of spare parts
else	No response from you
else	I have already sent an email on the email id lenovocarepune@gmail.com however haven't received any reply yet. Overall service at the BM Gadgets services pvt. Ltd., Pune was disappointing. I was not informed for 4 days about what issue was there with my phone. When i called at the service centre for 25 times, no one picked up the calls. Which was very annoying. When i visited the centre personally, they denied their mistake. Which was again annoying. I was supposed to  get my phone back on 18th June. However i got it on 24th June.
else	to speed up the spare part replacement process
else	Time to wait for the service is too long.  The schedule was changed 3 times before a technician was dispatch.
else	We have next day onsite service, but the part was shipped to us but we did not receive a call from the technician until 3 days after the initial call.
else	Pay for shipping as part of your warranty. I spent $85 on shipping to send the laptop, as insurance was only possible through Postal Canada, not with FedEx. In the US, they offer a $20 option with FedEx that seems to have an insurance deal with FedEx but FedEx will not Insure packages for individual purchases. Why do you not have the option in Canada?
else	Have techs that are able to troubleshoot or fix issues over the phone or remote sessions. Or if escalated like mine, make sure someone actually calls me back. 16 days and not a single call back and the ticket is CLOSED IS UNACCEPTABLE!
else	Make the options clearer when clients call, I chose the wrong option as I wasn't sure which one related to my problem. Otherwise, nothing else.
else	I am unable to use full disk space as my system is not allowing me to create disk partiton. Some space on the disk is lying unallocated.
else	Reduce your service timing and check parts properly before sending .
else	Staff attitude not professional at all. As if doing a charity.
else	If there are delays clearly communicate them, and provide regular updates with meaningful descriptions, then make sure to give accurate ETAs
else	Computer was returned without service & more problems
Agent	Improve chat agent times
else	Before returned items back to customers recheck and test for the problems to minimized inconvenient of extending their times.
else	Repair and return in better condition
else	Read the ticket and send the correct part.
else	May be make products better as on many of our laptop screen issues and keyboard issue came. so my request is to make product which are solid enough
else	Make it easier to resolve an issue and find the right customer service contact.  It tools a bit of hunting on the site to find the chat option.  Forcing the customer the knowledge base without showing other options easily is very time consuming.
else	Explain why your return shipment process kept getting cancelled multiple times!
else	get a vendor that calls on time
else	Give status updates.  I didn't hear anything about the process from the moment I sent the laptop in until I physically received it back.
else	The problem was delivery of parts took very long. I suppose Lenovo cannot do anything about it...
else	take issue on time and easily.
else	Make sure they dont loose track of where the computer is
else	Better updates throughout the process. Took months to get computer back or feedback.
else	Make sure the phone representatives provide the accurate information and put all the accurate information in the ticket  Allow phone representative to update to the  get without pushing the service date by a full day each time
else	Allow customers to change return package delivery address after submission of the support request.
else	Improve contact with customer and keeping the customer updated on current status of system. It took over two months to have my laptop returned even though I declined repair. I constantly had to call customer service to try and receive the status of my machine. The reps just kept telling me to check online status.
else	Please speed up your service and store more spare parts
else	Take feedback on call only
else	i had not received a proper information from your service team side and i getting trouble by your service team. Please improve your terms and conditions and improve your service team to respond quickly to customer needs and improve your warehouse team to available all parts in warehouse
else	Please send part on time
else	No questions asked return.
else	If I have a defective laptop, either replace the part yourself or issue me a new laptop as I return the old one.
else	Better QC on refurbished parts
else	The technician came in on a day when I was not here.  His instructions were to replace an LCD screen due to the previous one not being seated correctly.  He did not understand the problem, so he tried to set up the computer from a factory reset state for diagnostics and couldn't figure out how.  He decided to report the problem solved and leave having done no work on the computer.  He did not replace or attempt any repair on the screen.
else	Reduce the parts delivery time.
else	Better coordination between parts delivery schedule and engineer visit schedule (for on-site service). Very frustrating that engineer initially booked to visit before part had arrived. I had to intervene to prevent wasted visit. Things then went quiet for a week with several calls to re-trigger engineer visit.
else	Ensure the shipping location of a replacement part is not shipped far away from the customer and service tech, my tech had to go nearly 2 hours out of the way to pick up my replacement system board
else	let their customers know that if the PC has a hard drive failure we should be given the option to receive back the bad hard drive in order to attempt a recovery of files.
else	Send the computer parts faster to fix customer issues.
else	Check more carefully before returning
else	Need to improve the part dispatch to customer.
else	I have still not received my Moto X style mobile from Motorola service center KRK Solutions, Marathalli, Bangalore. I gave it for repair on 2nd Jan 2018, however everytime I call to enquire, the Motorola service center employees reply that the battery is still on the way and they have not received it yet. Its almost  2 months. I am very disappointed with Motorola service as I think it should not take this much time just for battery replacement.
else	Check your work before sending unit back out.
else	Improve the parts call center and retrain supervisor. Supervisor at parts call center was extremely rude and had that been my only interaction, I would never recommend Lenovo to anyone again.
else	the wait
else	Make sure everything is working before returning
else	Fix and return item in less than the 21/2 months it took. No update were supplied.. Hell the STATUS CHECKER SAID IT WASN'T RECEIVED. i HAD TO CALL
else	Send the correct part with your technician
else	haven't received a call back yet, my phone was customized and got sent back a regular phone without my initials.
else	Keep delay on part replacement more than 2 weeks
else	We only had 1 issue and that was a bad part that the tech received.  He figured it out immediately and was replaced the next day.
else	Communication was apauling false updates and over 9minuite wait time every time we had to chase
else	So late for software update
else	Service center should make sure they order the part.  I had to call a second time because it was not ordered
else	Update warranty on call also
else	Took multiple contacts to get the part shipped.  The last person I spoke with was able to get it done!
else	My laptop was returned in worse condition than submitted.
else	During the conversation, with the technical support staff, the call was dropped off at the middle of the process and no one called back. I will suggest the staff to be advised to call back in this kind of situation as if the customer call back he/she again have to hold for long periods and will have to explain everything to the new staff again from the scratch.
else	Send working parts the first time.
else	Fix hardware issues know with your product or recall units that are known to be bad.
else	I tried several times to access what was fixed, via info on an email sent to me, and it failed everytime.  I do not understand what re-imaging means.
else	better and more transparent communication, faster repair
else	Send the right parts
else	The tracker button was damaged but not replaced
else	make sure the replacement part is not faulty too.
else	They sent over the affected hardware parts in expedited delivery which reduced downtime on our end.
else	The first Motherboard that came was faulty.
else	My warranty was valid, although staff for motorola product collection was not enough knowledgeable.
else	There was no check after sending a couple of spare parts out to me, that 1.  I had the time to try fitting them myself, or more importantly, 2. That they had fixed the problem.Which they didn't.
else	make assistance support easier to find and contact
else	If you have issues getting parts let the customer and the dispatch know about it.
else	Damage part
else	Solve technical problem faster
else	only notify of return date or time table
else	Reduce amount of time waiting. Improve kindness/politeness. Improve websites for possible solutions to decrease phone calls for simple technical support.
Agent	have better customer services as each one we spoke to were rude!!!
else	Computer received back damaged
else	It took too long to get a resolution. Three visits from a tech and then I was offered a replacement computer that would take 2-4 weeks to be supplied.
else	Wrong part is delivered first time
else	Product not received
else	Confirm receipt of the computer to be repaired by allowing for tracking or sending an email that the computer was received. Also, send out tracking on the day the computer is sent back to owner.
else	Delivery of parts must be faster.
else	Shorter call hold time
else	Turn up on time and call back to make another appointment if you miss it (which you haven't done yet)
else	faster parts delivery, correct parts reflecting our configuration
else	If it's not been fixed within 2 or 3 days of when you said you would start it then email me with an update.
else	Lenovo tech support seems very disconnected in that departments are unable to communicate effectively between themselves.  Tech support DID NOT resolve scheduling the repair or return phone calls or call back as promised.  I wont be buying Lenovo products in the future.
else	Im not happy w burning up 2 power cables in the first 2 months I had the unit. I dont know what you can do about that
else	Service center personal are technically too poor and they don't have basic manner about how to behave with the costumer l personally suggest you to please change the franchise of that service center
else	The problem was misdiagnosed, and the device was returned as a software malfunction, but in actuallity it was a hardware issue.
else	Extend Warranty applied, thru i computing, Coimbatore, still your site not updated, please check
else	Explain that replacement parts are not delivered to site and rather somewhere for the engineer to collect.
else	I received a replacement phone with no hassle. The customer support agents were friendly and professional.
else	Provide the parts faster and then fix the unit without it coming back less than a week later
else	The wrong part was purchased, shipped, and follow up scheduled with the client. The client stayed late, only to find their efforts were in vain. The client has already had a very bad history with hardware requests.
else	Nothing really - I was lucky i had the phone number from a previous request - sometimes it is hard to find as I think you prefer that help chat thing on line. The chap whohelped me was very reasring as the BIOS update had got stuck and I knew you shouldn't just stop it. He took over and did everything including fixing another small update that hadn't worked.
else	Just replace my machine after you fail fixing it 4 times
else	I am uncertain, but I feel like sending the item in has caused issues with unrelated items to the service.(sent in for cosmetic defects, began experiencing HDD issues when returned)
else	I submitted phone for the main speaker problem but then when repaired the hearing phone call speaker voice was not clear and the voice of the person who calls is repeating in their phone ie problem with the microphoneAnd the issue had not been solved in 3 times now also I have to visit the centre once more.I want my phone replaced.
else	The buttons should NOT respond like a mouse pad when you slide your finger across them.
else	provide contact numbers for support that don't require transfers.
else	Didn't receive notification of replacement
else	In future use DHHS IT department to contact staff that Lenovo will be in contact.Inform staff of what the fault is, as there was no communication on what the problem was.
else	Technicians/ Service men are technically poor in the service center. They can't able to find the problem. Rather they focus on small dents visible on the product and they try to frighten the customer about other problems which may encounter while repairing.
else	Faster resolution time and train your engineers to handle customer products with care and clean the product after service.
else	need to improve plastic part quality
else	Reduce repair leadtimes
else	There were very little techs at the repair centre, the line was quite slow and there was no seating area at the location
else	shorter wait times to customer service.
else	Provide timely updates and details on what's being done.  My machine was at the depot for 2 weeks where in the first couple days I was told 'everything was fine' and the drive just needed to be re-imaged; I went along with it knowing the drive was fine but I was tired of arguing.  A week after that still no laptop and a call resulted in 'it's being worked on'.  Why?  I thought 'everything was fine'?  after MULTIPLE calls ad 2 weeks I finally got the laptop back to find out the system board was replaced...again.  Perhaps if you had listened to me that the HDMI port and mini DisplayPort weren't working I'd have received my laptop sooner.  Of course, if you had bothered to test the system board you put in when I first sent it in for a failed USB port I never would have had to send it back.
else	Serial No-PF0VVBHJSO No-7009064434With due respect, I claimed my ADP warranty ,which on online diagnosis had registered 8 parts replacement. But after a few days , an engineer visited on the site for offline diagnosis and he reported 7 parts replacement claiming that the D part will be fitted after replacing the C part. So no need to change the D part.But when the engineer visited on site for replacement of the parts on 12th of December, the D part was not fitting with the C part . On claiming for a revisit, the engineer came very late and that too on 31st of december after 20 days .  And in the onsite report of revisit , It is mentioned that Harikesh sir will deal with the matter and certain screenshots & photos were shared with the revisited engineer on his whatsapp as directed by him. But no one replied to me since then.Its mere rubbish that this typical nonsense quality of service is provided by LENOVO where the onsite engineer gives assurance that my problem will be resolved and then no one even contacts me till I make a call from my side.The case is still not closed. Please give me the updates as soon as possible because my warranty is going to end by 26th of january,2019 .The name of the engineer with whom the snaps are shared is PABITRO MOHANTY.And the service report of onsite engineer for diagnosis as well as the revisit case is attached.Also the online diagnosis conducted earlier(where D part was mentioned for replacement but then denied by the engineer who came for offline diagnosis ) snapshot is attached & the laptop snaps are also attached.Please handle the case as quickly as possible.FEEDBACK: very bad service.
else	part was a little slower than expected
else	See first comment box about missing items on return of product.  Required to sent check list of items sent, but no check list was sent back showing all received items were being shipped back.
else	Your engineers are not professionals
else	Provide a local number in Colombia so that I don't to contact US for Premium support. Other than that, you were exceptional.
else	I still have problems with the unit
else	shorter wait time to access the help desk
else	Not forget about the ticket and keep me updated
else	Immediate technical support required
else	Make software updates easier and able to remain problems caused but MS updates.
else	Improve communication between your thirdparty dispatch technicians on proper tracking of parts.
else	kindly arrange the parts as soon as possible.
else	Send all related parts with tech on the FIRST trip.  He made 4 trips before completion.  Should have been 2.  First trip out he should have all possible parts for original problem statement, 2'nd trip he should have had all possible parts for newly discovered issue.
else	hold more spare parts as it took a while to get replacement part.
else	Initially it was very difficult to receive feedback or hear back about the status of my support case. However, once the service provider did get in touch with me, it was smooth sailing. He was communicative, helpful, and efficient.
else	Send right parts on first round
else	I highly recommend that you communicate better with your customers, UPS collected my product, I was told that Id receive an email to tell me when they were collecting my laptop, i had NO communication until he was knocking my door to collect it and had to wait for me to pack it up.  NO communication received throughout the process, and NO email to inform me that my laptop had been despatched/in transit back to me.
else	Improve the technical and trouble skills
else	Front office staff not at all professional
else	As of yet, I have not received the replacement charger that I was told I would have within 4 business days. This is now going on almost 3 weeks.
else	Provide more details in the work order, such as what the suggested replacement parts are.
else	keep customer updated on progress. waited for a week and has to go down to service center to know that it'll take another week.
else	please update my warranty status....
else	I gave 4 . But this is not for  technician this is for Lenovo tech department
else	I have had problems with the shatter sheld peeling off since 2 weeks after having the phone and sent it in 3 times to get the screen fixed and on the 3rd time u guys charged me for the fix when my problem was never fixed in the first place... I am not happy at all with the customer service
else	Better quality of hardware parts. We have had several computers that i have had to swap out for being defective, and it seems more and more are breaking.
else	Increased response convenience and resolution of the problem
else	keep parts local
Agent	Less hold time before speaking with tech. 15 min on hold.
else	Update the service request in real time, give ETA on return.
else	reduce waiting time to connect to right dept
else	"Have the call centre staff understand the process of call logging, as I was passed around your call centre multiple times, and hung up on more than once while on hold waiting to be transferred to the 'correct department'. Even after speaking to our account manager, this was not resolved, as the resolution she gave just pointed me back to the same people I had already rung, and been told ""this is not the right department, you would need XXXXX department"".I expected the repair to be almost immediate once you received the device, but this took weeks because you didn't have the parts for the device (despite it being a relatively new model).Honestly, in my opinion, the only saving grace about my dealings with your company was Karen Jones, Senior Account Manager at Lenovo Repair Depot, Flex UK. She was extremely helpful with every correspondence we had. If I could ensure she was my point of contact going forward I would be more than happy to use your services, because no other members of staff provided even close to the level of customer service I would expect for a paying customer."
else	You need a bit more flexibility and communication on timeslots, perhaps the ability to request a specific date or to pay for a timeslot. I asked multiple times for advanced notice of when an engineer would be attending and then I would get a call 10 minutes before they entered the building.Part availability on these laptops seems terrible also, it took 3-4 months to get a system board swapped because the part would take a month to arrive, the engineer would arrive on dates we specifically asked to avoid, he would say to call up and rebook for tomorrow, then the part would be sent back and we would have to wait another month.Communication is just terrible in general. It got to the point where we couldn't get a part or an engineer, but I couldn't get an update from anyone that wasn't just stalling and diversion.
else	Is the second time I use costumer Support and it's very slow and dont give any feedback to costumer.
else	send your technician with proper replacement part
else	Not hound people when they take a few hours to answer an email - It felt excessive to expect such a quick response from me when I have work etc.
Agent	Call centre staff that are not rude and actually care about the customer. Call centre staff that talk to each other so I don't have to verify my detail with each staff member.
else	I had to insist on Lenovo providing a box and shipping for the return. I had previously spent $60 when returning the computer for a display failure.
else	provide instructions
else	Provide laptops that work, shorten the waiting time for the support service when laptops are sent to repair. provide a service with substitutive laptops when user remains without the original one
else	i love the computer  your tech on phone told me to reset computer as in clean it as if you would be recycling it she said if i did it would be and i quote like brand new out of box  it really messed it up and i had to take it back to best buy for them to fix it which took almost 2 days    techs very difficult to understand  the best of 3 i could understand the best except her information according to best buy geeks said it was totally unnecessary  i wanted them to just give me a new one but they wanted to fix it.
else	You did not fix my problem on the phone and I had to return the laptop to your service center.  I still have not heard anything about the problem from the service center.
else	Improve the time between call logging and parts delivery.As a technician myself I would have been happy to receive the parts.
else	Issue resolution time = 01 Day
else	Better customer hotline staff knowledge
else	Poor instructions on cru modules such as USB port
else	Ensure that I receive the exact same parts as well originally installed in my notebook, in a timely manner. My screen replacement resulted in a matte screen instead of a glossy screen, which functions but has different characteristics and color reproduction from the old one.
else	Lenovo needs to improve the parts distribution process, it shouldn't take nearly a month to get a part. We are a corporate customer that has purchased 17 tablets, 2 desktops, and about 7 laptops over the last three years.  We are not sure about using the brand in the future, we love the products but they are worthless if you can't service them in a reasonable amount of time. We paid for service we didn't get, on the CEO's laptop yet. It was fixed on the first visit by the tech, but it took multiple calls and follow ups to get the part here in the first place. Please see all orders that went through lhhospice@sbcglobal.net, and stevenkotlarz@gmail.com, we were loyal customers, the experience was a shame.
else	By QA-ing the products better so a retail $2700 machine doesn't get shipped to a customer, who then has to go through many weeks of waiting and transitions for a replacement.
Agent	Make it easire to access the person you need and speed up the process, I was on hold probably 45-60 minutes.
else	Improve the usability of the site fo update the guarantee. It is really confusing when one wants to extend in one more year.
Agent	Better reaction times, better technical knowledge of agent
else	sense of urgency with returning the device to me.
else	The product was totally new and was already malfunction when I received it. I took it to WORTEN repair in Colombo (Lisboa) and the guy said that it was normal with that type of product.I called Lenovo and they solve my problem but it was hard to find lenovo Phone number for technical support in Portugal.
else	Better communication and time to resolution
else	Have quicker response
else	you can have some return  phone calls when asked
else	Check issues are resolved under normal operation conditions prior to returning device
else	resolve the issue on time.
else	To provide better assurance thru phone help desk
else	Better communication and email updates dont work
Agent	I made the call on a day when I could afford the time . . . the agent had a real heavy accent, as if he were from Fiji or the Philippines, so I had to ask him to repeat himself several times . . . Thankfully, he had the patience to stick with me until the problem got solved . . . Sadly, I don't always have that much time to spend.
else	cannot update as suggested and a laptop should work properly from day one which this one hasnt
else	Improve the service response time.The engineer was brilliant and professional- well done!
else	still waiting for tech to call for appointment
else	Learn from the tech that came to DPW! The tech drove through heavy Bay Area traffic to get to the laptops and replace a motherboard and fan
else	Not be concerned with sending out more than 1 part, I had a problem that could have been motherboard or cpu. I received the MB, did not fix, then CPU, fixed.
else	Order the correct part from the start so additional technician visits are not required.
else	facility improvement such as comfortable area with entertainment such as TV, drinks & updates magazine etc.  also I was queued first to the recall counter but when I told that I need to check the cam function then who asked me to restart over to get the ticket to queue with service, certainly I was intended to take a short cut as I noticed that it has less waiting on recall's line, but it's not my fault as most of customers will do the same if they have the same situation, it's the fault of customer unless there is a sufficient notice to alert them or you can have the same staff at recall counter well trained to handle the general matter as well, so that you save the time of your customer and this is so called customer service.
else	They should have a local computer shop like PC world so that customers can go there and talk to them about their product. And also help with having more space on Lenovo idea pad so that my windows 10 will be updated
else	Provide actual real world support response times. Provide real world feasible fixes. Telling me to reinstall Windows on a device that we have literally just powered on, that was delivered straight from Lenovo warehouse is a pretty crappy look. It's pretty much like buying a new car and then when you drive it out the door, they tell you that you need an engine rebuild because the engine they shipped has problems. If you were the consumer, would you want to use that car?
else	Support person need more knowledge on assembly and disassembly of the product
else	Simply...24 hour onsite service should be that...not 24 hours to deliver a part and another 24 hours to get a tech out here...
else	Don't say it will be returned within nine days of receiving it but it actually took three weeks. This placed a inconvenience on me as well as others who allowed me to use their laptop to perform work duties...
else	Provide more buffer unit for parts replacement
else	Please provide professional way of customer support
else	Only a part of the problems reported was taken care of. I reported an issue with a used and dirty charger for instance being sent with the unit. I contacted the reseller who said he didn't open the package from Lenovo. I contacted Lenovo and I'm told you won't cover the charger issue but I should contact the reseller. Why so?
else	I need someone to contact me on how to return the damaged hard drive
else	From back to worse, I don't think any improvement after my feedback.I had call many times and more than 30 emails still no reply. I had reported the case for about 3 weeks ago, yet my problem never settled!!!! IT REALLY VERY SERIOUS ATTITUDE PROBLEM FROM ALL LEVELS FROM HOTLINE STAFF, ON-SITE ENGINEER, NOBODY INTERESTED TO WORK. MY COMPANY IS MULTINATIONAL COMPANY BOUGHT MILLIONS OF LENOVO LAPTOPS , YET PROVIDE SUPER BAD SERVICE!!! THEY REALLY NEED TO JOLLY WELL WAKE THIER IDEAS.IF OTHERS THEY SCREAM AT YOU.  VERY FRUSTATING!!! WHEN CAN SETTLED MY PROBLEM!!! I VERY BUSY YET STILL WRITE THIS EMAIL.
else	"When receptionist is taking calls, it is better to transfer immediately to the support staff, not to say ""please bring your computer to the closest ""Goos guys"" as a majority of minor request can be solved remotely by giving technician an authorisation to repair your computer."
else	Better communication between parts and service.
else	10+ calls in one day with no resolution.
else	provide ETA on box shipped out to return laptop in.
else	The online chat system needs to be improved in overall along with right options so that there no confusion between consumer or technical chat.
else	Even though part is replace machine not working satisfactorily
else	Lenovo stopped returning emails and calls - even though they indicated they would and they knew the issues were unresolved.
else	the chat was awful, 45min wait just to chat then the chat rep was rude and had no info, then the email was vague says its sending part to my site, which it wasn't then the tech gave be a 2hr window for which he didn't show up till afterwards
else	the computer is slower than expected, and did not expect the speakers to break so quickly-the repair was handled well but not so satisfied with the product itself
else	Faster resolution
else	Provide estimated lead time on parts.
else	As understand, it will be a recurring issues as the laptop  capacity cannot stop Win updates
else	shorten waiting time and get professional technician
else	A more comprehensive update
else	"The parts were changed and the technician saw that the computer was slow and he said "" if the computer still not working is your right reported"". And I want to reported."
else	Speedy resolution and onus for better customer service
else	The only thing I would say that can be improved is the return delivery. By giving the customer some information about the date it will be delivered
else	Computer not working after 1 month old doesn't speak much about the product then the representative didn't know how to help us on the phone.  Going to Best Buy to get it repaired then not being able to get it fixed without a fee was a waste of time.  The representative should have been able to talk us though a factory reset.  The information she did provide didn't work.  When shipped to company that is all they did is factory reset it.
else	Pay for and send a shipping label. For a public school it's a lot to pay $24 to ship a laptop for it to be fixed.
else	1  This didn't require multiple days, it just took two calls . . . after pressing all the right keys on the first call, your system hung up on me.
else	Reduce the price of spare parts
else	keep a better stock on parts
else	tech that can comunicate and not replaced parts that were not bad
else	IBM techs need to arrive on time and communicate. I should not have to contact Lenovo support in order for IBM techs to arrive on time, which they failed to do so. Lenovo support needs to follow up as they promised. The solution I was promised which was replacement of my laptop has not been provided to me.
else	Due to the telephone connection, I had a difficult time understanding the technician/representative.
else	Still waiting for repair
else	Send a Tracking Number so can Track for Return of Item..It was pure luck someone was in to receive the Item.
else	faster turn-around on repairs
else	brand-new ThinkPad P1 received with defected parts. Customer service could ship replacement parts or replace the laptop. That result returning the P1! very unprofessional! 2 months after I returned the P1, Lenovo customer service still thinks if I have the laptop and sends me this satisfaction survey!
else	"Have had several technical failures with X1 laptops. I like the performance and form factor, but am not feeling comfortable with the reliability of these machines. Although noting was wrong with my machine in this instance, I had to plead with the call center to help me with the inspection for loose screws without sending my machine off to a service center for a week or more. So offering this right away with out making it an ""exception"" makes sense to me for a 3 month old machine that is this expensive."
else	return my calls on emails
else	Make sure software updates are working properly before they are issued. My fault was due to a bad update.
else	Provide a carrier when I receive my laptop back so I can carry it w me
else	Delay of attending customersIt took 2.5 hours waiting for my software update
else	Instead of replacing with new parts but faulty parts being used trouble shot, causing more issues and wasting a lots of time !
else	Have correct, functional parts available.
else	Do what you commit to doing. Do it on time. Communicate when you fail to meet these expectations.
else	More communication updates re. the shipping, repair, and return shipping would be helpful.  I had to call to get updates.
else	please send service on next business day will be good , always facing case part is no available .
else	"Too slow for repair. No matter what your service depot moved to somewhere, repiar should be done within reasonable time frame. I sent my item on the end of June and repiar depot got it on July 5th. Nobody stared repairing until I called July 18th. After the first call, they started repairing on July 19th and no progress for 7 businessday. I called second again and nobody know what was going for my laptop. Rep said  ""someone started repairing."" That was it. Rep requested expedited process. Anyway I got it back on Aug 10th. However, they did not send back charger. Finally I can reuse my laptop on Aug 13th."
else	Are you kidding me. Never received a call regarding this and the problem still exists.
else	can improve in calling
else	Problem did reoccur once after the service
else	Replacement parts were sent damaged. They weren't damaged in shipping, they were damaged before leaving the factory.
else	Provide a shipping label so my computer can be serviced
else	I have returned the computer to service. They shipped it to another location. I'm still waiting for it to be resolved.
else	I wish your company can set up a clear support phone-line, and train the workers there more pro. The final pro. she uses 10 seconds solved my problem. Thanks! But before her I spent 3 hours talked with someone else, and transferred the calls from software to hardware to different company.
else	Pay for shipping on warranty returns!!!!
else	You should replace defective parts with new ones not refurbished parts. You replaced my mother board with a refurbished one and my laptop is only three months old.
else	Give all support not only hardware but also software part.
else	Kindly give the service on time.
else	Long waiting time on phone
else	Resolve the erroneous email that comes indicating your 'part is backordered'; apparently this was a known bug but caused me to make a couple phone calls to determine if service would occur or not as I was on the fence about FedEx-ing my machine back to my corporate office rather than having a service call.
else	I've updated my Lenovo k8 for Bluetooth problem but after the update, problem is still persists.
else	Have dealer better informed as to shipping of the unit with or without the battery.
else	Advise on progress and ETA of return timescale.......no way of checking. Tracking indicated delivery but it was unclear that it was delivered to Service centre not to my address. Thought that it had been repaired and returned to wrong address but had only just been received at Service centre.
else	My mobile was having auto shutdown problem and i submitted mobile to service centre and after 5 days they returned...but still issue is not resolved...
else	Be more  professional - this experience really threw me off
else	A bit slow took almost 4 months for the tablet to be returned
else	No one contacted us to fix the issue.   Our machine is covered under 3 years onsite warranty.  Your side has twice now told us that it is not.  We have add to get your side to check in order to service this machine multiple times.  Your system should be better updated.
Agent	Reduce hold time.  Was over 40 minutes.
else	I received back a replacement for the touchpad on my computer that was somewhat defective and below what I expected. Taking the time to thoroughly review each repair before it is shipped back to the customer will help reduce additional repairs.
else	Call back not done as promisedIt took a while over the phone to get to talk to the right person
else	quite slow to get the unit collected . Sat on our desk for a week.
else	Fix units that are only one month old.
else	Less wait time on the phone or online chat
else	Need to work in a lot of part from customers service prospective
else	Flawless return and replacement of my broken phone.
else	Actually fix the problem instead of continuing to send the wrong part. Actually listen to both the customer and the technician who are informing you which part to actually send.
else	direct transfer the call to technical team
else	During my repair, the online tracker did not update, so I had to call in several times to check the status of my repair.
else	Even a known issue of secondary battery causing issues was not fixed proactively; based on various feedback the product should be timely rectified in future releases.Proactively the known issues should be fixed for the products already in market with warrant instead of reactive support
else	Better warranty service for the technically challenged.
else	faster after sales service and easier to replace the part without waiting long
else	I went to the service center 3-4 times for Ghost Touch issue but your technical team is so incompetent that they can not resolve it even on the 4th visit. Then i get a call from the service center asking about the feedback, when  i told him that the issue is still there, he tells me that all Motorala phones have ghost touch issues and can not be resolved. I think i have been fooled after buying this phone. Will never buy Motorola again and this feedback is going on my FB and other social media accounts.
else	Replace broken notebook that is not fixable in reasonable time window and don't let customer wait for two months without resolution (without notebook and without replacement notebook)!
else	I was told a tech would be out next day and I would get a call to schedule a time window.  That call never came the next day.  I call support back and was told it would be another day.  I finally decided to perform the inspection myself and cancelled the service tech.  I hope I won't need a service call in the future because who knows if anyone will even come out.
else	I had to wait too long for the service call due to the part being shipped very slowly.
else	speed for part delivery
else	My Hand set was not switch on, i was visit to Lenovo service Center Siliguri, they return my set within one hour. pretty Impressive. Like it.
else	Please send feedback link for each calls
else	Sort out the generic (incorrect) auto emails sent to inform about parts.
else	Waiting for part arrive take 4 to 8 week is too long, hope can improve to 2 to 4 weeks.
else	Fix the defective product or give me refund.It has been returned 4 times now and still not fixed. Same defect remains.
else	The laptop stayed at your service depot for a very long time -more than one month to wait for parts to get repair.
else	Let people know what's going on ex. Give updates especially if it's going to take longer than expected!
else	Follow through on sending out parts.
Agent	Stop cheating, deceiving & being mean.Be truthful & orient your policies towards earning customers' delight through the kind of service which you speak of & make your customers expect. It is possible and requires little concerted effort.Thanks for letting me share the frustrating pain - caused by Lenovo - I had been suffering from, . I hope this feedback serves your purpose & interest. Whatever, I am feeling relieved.
else	Better quality of the product, better way to reach support (first time I called the system was down, second time I never received a callback, third time they called back immediately though I had scheduled it for two hours later), and quicker turnaround.
else	In terms of customer service and this call, nothing. It was fantastic and super helpful. Thank you.
else	Very unprofessional after sale service, fooling customers in the name of company policy
else	customer support is very bad no knowledge at all please provide good training
else	The technical assistant Lenovo sent was not prpfessional enough and have poor communication across the functional group in Lenovo. I hope that you all can have better communication in Lenovo and the technical assistance can have better professionalism in repairing.
else	"Repair and return the product in less than 8 weeks.  When it gets ""escalated"" don't bother to have a rep call me if he really doesn't care that I've been waiting 7 weeks for my computer and doesn't know when it will be back."
else	shipping overnight both ways really cut down on the amount of time it took to send/receive the phone.  the warranty center handled the analysis in a very short time frame, the replacement was sent out the same day they received the phone.  overall i was without the phone for only a few days, I consider this to be excellent service and I'm very glad that motorola handled in such a way.  A+++ would recommend a motorola phone to friends/family due to this experience.
else	I am still waiting with no planned resolution
else	Installation instructions, local dealer support, build quality products
else	Local service centres, operators who can speak English, faster turnaround of emails, lower timeframe to repair
else	Make sure issues does not arise due to wrong update of information in your systems
else	reduce the technical problems when a product is new.
else	Get it right to begin with. Train the call center staff to better assess the root cause and not order parts if it is not the problem
else	Last tech told me to hold on, and he never came back and didn't call me back and he had my phone number.  He did not know how to fix my issue.
else	Faster answers to change the spare parts you send. Maybe less e-mails will be better, you send redundant e-mails.  Will be better to have a way to contact directly answering from the e-mails.
else	It take long time to verify the issue
else	Computer returned with same issue. Our IT personnel solved the issue finally.
else	kindly arrange the parts at the earliest.
else	Better check your stocks, s what ive initially received was like a guinea pig item, it was disappointing to use the first time, I needed the laptop asap but Ive lost 2 weeks of my business because of it.
else	I called on 08/27/18 at 7:50 PM  After waiting an hour I was  disconnected.  I called back and waited another hour and no one answered the call.
else	Computer still broken, waiting for return
else	get the right parts and confirm what parts are needed for each WO before coming onsite. I took two days off to get this work done and both times it was the wrong part. The techs should call atleast couple of days in advance to schedule an appointment and not the morning of
else	We received quite a few communications, the first being that the part wasn't in stock so we needed to wait, then again from the tech changing the time that he could come out. It wasn't too bad, but it did seem a tad bit unprofessional.
else	resolve issue, tecniican on site was on site to perform specific actions, IE, change a specific part.    The technician should work to resovle an issue not just change a part.
else	Wasted my time first eng came and not even open and verify it's cofee  like liquid dame and went out ..After 1 week one more eng came and open verify it's due to heating it's become like that..and finally he changed .Very worst experience with support I never like to go again same product
else	Windows 10 is the issue and would prefer automatic updates like chrome books but compatible with the jaw program.
else	We had to make THREE phone calls before we received the box to ship the computer back in.  We never received a box after the first call---nor did we get an email or any correspondence.  So, we called 5 days later and we were told that we would receive a shipping box and confirmation email. Again, nothing---no box and no email.  Five days later we called AGAIN and finally got an email regarding our repair order and we received a box.  That was very frustrating.
else	2 dozen phone calls, aozen or more emails,  countless hours spent  repeatedly explaining my problems and more than a month waiting. Spent over 270$ for a replacement  phone and Motorola is still holding 400 in deposits. Motorola is very uncooperative,  inflexible and unable to affect resolution.  Don't think I will ever deal with them again.
else	After received  the Mobile(Lenovo K 8 Plus)from your service centreon 05.01.2018 from Kalitala,Serampore, Hooghly , still now I have no prolem. Thank you.
else	Faster response and faster delivery of spare part replacement.

else	Ensure that outsourced partners who are responsible for repairs meet their delivery obligations and SLA.
else	Better communication on times and days of service call.
else	Understand customer problem provide resolution in first visit
else	As  former C.E. from IBM, the first time I called your people should have told me how to fix the problem.  What they did was tell me to go to Best Buy and they would fix it for me.  I took it there and Best Buys told me to send back to Lenovo  as they had no idea what to do.  I called Lenovo back and the last one I talked to told me to push this hidden switch on the laptop and that would let me reset it back to its new condition which is was  anyway.I NEVER USE THE LAPTOP ANYMORE because with windows 10. it's to slow and the security is to rigid for me.  I prefer windows 7 and was going to install it but I don't want to waste my money if it doesn't speed the unit up.   If you want to some what please me, you can send me the version of windows 7 that will eliminate windows 10.THANKS FOR YOUR CONCERN,                                                       Allen J Graf        arnyj@aol.com
else	Make sure that updates do not make your computer unusable after the update is installed!
else	No suggested solution, the technician arrived at End of Business and never came back to resolve the problem.
else	seems Lenovo has a known problem with multi port type c driving second screen.  That was my issue and it took to times sending to depot for Lenovo to get it fixed.
else	Give kudos to John, who helped me on phone Tuesday evening on 30 January 2018.  The above section did not accept my number 9.
else	Engineer assigned for resolving the issue understood the issue and quickly did his job with almost perfection. But in the first time, defected motherboard came , 2nd time motherboard was of some different processor. In the 3rd time, motherboard was proper
else	Provide updates on open cases
else	Don't return my product with additional problems that didn't exist when I sent it in
else	Lack of feedback when an engineer was going to attend.
else	Regular updates must be given to the customer about the delay in the process
Agent	Got disconnected and could not logon again without starting from scratch,
else	Not really you guys are top notch, just parts take long to be shipped
else	Quicker response time.Tell the truth.
Agent	Speed up online hold times.
else	Keep me better updated on whats going on.
else	It took a long time for the engineer to come to me and for the team to log
else	"It took over a month to get my laptop serviced due to a ""parts shortage"" at Lenovo. I did not have a functioning laptop for over a month. Lenovo should keep its parts well stocked to avoid this in the future. Although the service technician was great, I would probably not get a Lenovo the next time I buy a laptop."
else	Maintain stock of proper parts.
else	Have better parts availability.  We pay an extra cost for onsite next day repair and it took 7 days to complete a simple repair.
else	have the part in stock so there are no business delays
else	The laptop hardware failed less then a week after repair, for the second time
else	Make updates more descriptive. I had no idea my board and cpu were blown until I got the package.
else	delay in delivery of parts
else	"The original technician assigned ""Andre"" delayed calling me for a few days after I received the parts. I received the parts on Monday and not until Friday did his friend ""Doug"" came to replace the parts. ""Doug"" was nice guy, very polite, but he was a Mac guy, not very familiar with PC, fortunately he was able to figure out the correct replacement of the parts. So far I haven't had problems. (I'm taking out stars because I remember the last time a technician came to replace the same parts he was very familiar with it and did it quickly)"
else	Please start providing system updates
else	My issue is unresolved, dont know how and why Lenovo is asking for feedback without resolving the issue.
else	you returned pc with same fault
else	Improve your technical team skills.
else	"you can build a better computer...3 months in and this computer has several problems, none of which were resolved by my call to you or Best Buy...within 2 months the ""data point' had failed and i couldn't get the internet..had to take it in to be fixed...since then, the majority of web pages i go to arbitrarily roll/freeze...and periodically now when i power up the computer  the ""data point"" fails again and i have to do the trouble shooting on the internet access...and your resolution to me and my problem was to "" clear the cache""...ha! i'd b e doing that all day!"
else	Although I received a defective replacement and wrong screen protector, the premium fee was waived and new phone was sent quickly. It was a nice week and a half break from having a phone I guess.
else	Stop calling me to fill the feedback form.!!!
else	Provide a faster response time to repair items
else	still waiting on replacement device
else	Share updates and  product installments with teachers
else	Slow understanding of customer care and technical support engineer.
else	Phone I received is defective.
else	the telephone operator should not ask for serial #, phone# etc but only transfer to the proper department for assistance. I was asked for the same information by two different parties delaying the process when that could have been avoided.
else	Immediate response with the satisfactory resolution.
else	My computer autofilled my home address and it was a hassle to change the return address to my work address.
else	The lady on the phone needs to have more patience with people with less knowledge than her on this product
else	The response time was very poor.  My warranty includes next business day response, but it took more than a week, and I even had to complain first.
Agent	Hard to understand agent.
else	Shouldn't have to send it for repair 2 times
else	The system came back powering on, but the dual screens on any docking station are not working properly and I have to send the unit right back in.
else	Service tech was great- he had to reinstall a screen a 2nd time because the replacement part was defective. He was great at communication and was anxious to get my issue resolved.
else	As for corporate customer lenovo needs to provide NBD support with engineer and parts availability
else	Better quality control before returning merchandise.
else	Faster shipping of parts would be useful. The part took 2 week to be available for the technician to come for installation.
else	Too much time waiting for someone to answet
else	Do not charge us to return an item that is still under warranty.
else	Return tracking indicated wrong carrier.
else	Faster resolution provided
else	Order the correct parts first time round - wrong mobo sent out
else	Better live updates on your supports page. Product disappears into your repair process with few updates.
else	I was referred to a local Authorized Lenovo Service location.  When I called them, they told me they only work on the main Lenovo lines NOT the Legion.  Could not help.  Best they could do was refer me to another local person (NOT LENOVO).  I eventually gave up and solved my problem without using the mini display port
else	Do not hound your customers for a response. At one point 3 - 4 attempts to contact me were made back to back while I was working after which a message was left that you had tried to contact me 3 times unsuccessfully and now are signing off. Who does that? Someone who is required to contact the customer a certain number of times before closing a case and wants to do it now! My problem was corrected but the overall interaction was annoying based on this practice.
else	Acknowledge product issues. Especially the ones that are broadly reported from various customers, like the one i faced. Try to resole the issue in a timely, efficient manner.
else	provide all necessary replacement parts in ample
else	I sent laptop in fir a 2nd time, waiting for the laptop to be received
else	I received conflicting emails about the availability of the keyboard being replaced but in the end it came and was replaced as first mentioned to me.
else	Please take better care to ensure all components and screws are installed before returning.
else	wait extended for a part that was not available. I have request twice to have the battery replacement which I believe is included in the extended warranty, but it has yet to be done. my battery time has gone from around 8 or 9 hours to approximately an hour and a half
else	computer crushing since device came back / 3 times
else	Maybe not to ask for the serial number or model upon filling out a field in request of a call back via email. This takes up time I may not have, and in this case, time was not on my side, as my battery was not charging.
else	Would be better if engineer came within the agreed timescale
else	Clarify how to return defective parts within the package sent with the replacement part
else	Enhence product knowledge of on-site technicians.
else	received the laptop with blue screen and continually updating.
else	Have techs that listen ( and can speak/understand the callers language). have Techs that know how to solve Lenove problems.
else	Do not charge customers to send items in for repair also when you receive an item let the customer know it has arrived. I had to call and was told it showed up on Tuesday but my tracking showed it was the the Friday before.
else	NO updates has come from the service centre but they replied all my emails, They suppose to provide the service updates
else	Service Center behavior not professional or even accessible.
else	Servers are detailed instructions for installation guidance are required with package and another one is servers front closing or hard disk hide door was not available with package but brochure and ads to mention the doors but packaging not available...
else	I have managed a telecommunications customer service and sales department and rarely, if ever, select the highest rating for a CSR. It's been several days but I can't recall any areas that need improvement..
else	Better communication skills with people working the phone
else	Ship the parts faster.
else	To deliver the parts as soon as possible.
else	no waiting to talk to the consultant.
else	Your staff are delivering mixed messages resulting in me travelling a 60 mile trip to a Currys Store only to be informed what your advisors had told me to be incorrect, in addition spent at least 60 minutes on phone
else	I have not yet received my laptop.
else	improve response time for tech
else	having to wait long time for service (talk on phone, hope the rep guesses right) wait for parts to be sent, schedule an onsite visit and then hope the right diagnose was made.
else	Decrease wait time for call pick up
else	By actually contacting us soon to discuss how we can fix the computer speed issues
Agent	My call was on hold multiple times and 80% of the call time was on hold. Each time after on hold was not coming back with any constructive action. Spent over an hour on the phone and finished by hanging up without waiting longer.
else	Rec'd computer back and now Windows won't update and load.  Waiting for assistance from my Lenovo employee nephew to determine if it can be resolved or if further assistance is needed
else	Frequent Windows10 updates to be minimised. Updates take long time when computer screen is blank.
else	Better explanation about drop off and returning lap top.
else	better turn around service/ several visits/ brought the wrong part
else	Fix the laptop so that I don't have to return it a fourth time or provide a replacement or refund for full price.
else	repair the fault more promptly, we waited over 3 weeks for the repair
else	Guy on phone giving correct information
else	Send parts to technicians faster.
else	attend sooner, communicate better and in plain English, turn up with correct and new parts
else	When I sent in my laptop for repair, I included my power cord with it and indicated such on the repair form in the designated spot. When my laptop was returned, which was prompt, the power cord was not included in it. After waiting on hold for literally 35 minutes, I spoke with a customer service representative who promised me it would be expedited and I would have a power cord in my hands no later than two days. Well, that was eight days ago. And I still have no power cord. Tracking says it will be here tomorrow, which will be seven days later than it was supposed to be here. This is been a serious disruption to my life as I planned the repair to be in between my online college courses. My online courses started last week. I am very frustrated that the shipment of my power cord was first forgotten and then not expedited.
else	If my harddisc is getting crashed due to system update then yiu should sent engineer with backup recovery option.I lost all the data including my family memories of 2 year which i stored there.And you guys just told me that we dont have recovery support
else	In Estonia, the Lenovos partner contacts (IBM Eesti) are somewhat hard to find on the internet.
else	Actually turn up and not lose the part
else	no one has shown up the install the new part
else	can less resolution time.
else	The Lenovo Engineerings are not updated.
else	I got a notification that the part was on backorder, but no timeline for when they thought it would come in.  Setting some expectations there would have been nice.
else	the system was not working and I had to call a few times but once we had everything in the system i did receive my phone very quickly and it all went smoothly.
else	Provide a realistic time frame for issue resolution and solution options. I submitted my issue on 7/13 and did not have it fully resolved until 7/23. I was originally told an IT field rep would assist me. Not only was there a delay in notifying the field rep about my issue (2 days after I called in the issue) , but they ended up being back logged and couldn't assist for another 2 days. There needs to be stronger communication between the call center and field reps. I ultimately sent my laptop to the service depot which originally wasn't presented as a solution when I called in my issue. If it was presented, I could have had my laptop 3-4 days earlier. That's 3-4 days of being unproductive.
else	supply all relevant parts on initial trip to customer site.  JIT is NOT conducive to timely service!!!!
else	Computer repair was slow and no power cord was returned with the computer.....no communication.....very poor service.
else	have more stock available as the waiting time for spare parts is very long.
else	Faster part shipping, fixing my laptop faster than three month down time, offering replacement if delays are expected to take this long, better customer engagement, more communication and updates,
else	Doublecheck if the unit is properly working after your work.
Agent	It is almost impossible to get any kind of support from the US.  I needed to open a ticket and I had to set up a VPN to China to actually submit a ticket.  Then I was told that my location was invalid.  No service assistance whatsoever.I purchased my laptop with Microsoft Office pre-installed.  I could never get it to register.  A complete waste of $120.  I do not plan to recommend Lenovo, nor Microsoft products to anyone.
else	I've noticed a delay on 20A7 parts. Keep the most often needed (screens, keyboards, motherboards) in stock.
else	Keep me updated on the progress of my product via email or something instead of me having to log in to see whats going on
else	Send the parts to me, so they don't get sent back when they are not picked up... and then Service Request cancelled and no notification...
else	Your team need to be trained in customer service protocol. When some one asks for information it is essential that updates are provided, even if the solution is not available . Keep the customer in the loop of where you are with trying to resolve their issues. Most customers will be happy for regular updates to say we haven't forgotten you. We are working toward a solution. Give a time frame and then revisit it with the customer. Communication is the key to every business.
else	Lenovo's technical support lacks the troubleshooting experience as I have to record a video recording of the issues. The Lenovo active pen that was check and confirmed to be faulty is expensive to purchase and take too long to indent. I then tried to change the battery and found that it is working fine. This is not my first incident that i have encountered such problem,
else	"1.  Keep track of my notebook, the agent on my last call to Lenovo said there is now no record of your machine in our system2.  Repair it immediately when the message in the Medion Service Status Quick Check says ""your computer will be repaired immediately"". (this happend 3 or 4 weeks ago now !)3.  Refund a proportion of the repair cost to match the level of service."
else	Provide actual updates. All I knew about my product was that it was still being worked on, and it was being worked on for three weeks. I didn't get any warning or any online updates regarding its status. My laptop is my work. I had to buy another laptop because it was taking too long, and no one was able to tell me what stage it was in. In addition to that, I didn't get any warning that it was being shipped back to me. I could have not been home, and someone could have stolen my laptop from my porch. Then what? Luckily, I get notifications from FedEx, but not getting necessary updates from Lenovo was discouraging. In addition to that, my touch screen works again, but it doesn't work properly. It's calibrated funny and works backward. I'm dreading calling because I don't want to send it in again, which will be the third time since I bought it November 2017. I've never had so many problems with a laptop, and I really want to like Lenovo, but this is just really discouraging.
else	They solve my problem but they remove my tempered glass for a simple software update . Now I have to repurchased my tempered glass which cost me 350rs
else	My experience is very bad with Motorola service .Sometime I am facing the battery issue with Motog4+Then I am going to koto service center my phone has submitted for 5days.he told this is battery issue and I am replace ur battery soon.after 5 days my mobile is return but battery issue is same .I don't know he change my battery or not..And not give any paper for battery replace..
else	Provide updates that correct issues with factory parts...where they do not communicate with the Operating System.
else	Don't leave me with a broken computer while I wait for the mail in package to arrive ... and don't leave me without a computer while I wait for my computer to be repaired and returned.  In other words, make repairs locally for faster service.
else	Faster turn around times. My 4 month old laptop had an issue, as a result it was sent back to Lenovo and after 2 weeks it was returned to me. This left me unable to run my business whilst my laptop was sent around Europe.
else	Send the complete part to be installed, and send a qualified technician, so that parts are not broken.
else	Didn't respond professionally, rude, provided information that was incorrect
else	You can provide updates on the status on the machine. And make sure that the online form to check the status is actually working.
else	Make parts somewhat affordable
else	Deliver Right Product, Not the refurbished Service parts to Get Repeated error
else	The parts had to be ordered, and the first part received was incorrect, resulting in delay.
else	Reduce long hold times when calling to initiate and update a support ticket
else	Promptly response is needed to improve
else	No product warranty received. Only 1 month service warranty provided. Service warranty and product warranty are not the same. New batteries and accessories come with 6 months warranty.
else	Have the laptop returned on the  time stated on the letter  without me making 10 phone calls (20 min a timeMy time  and phone calls were never compensated for.  And also 50 euro spent  to set it up again
else	The wrong part was originally sent.
else	parts were not immediately available
else	The online callback feature should be instant.
else	Provide the parts to the technician and service the device sooner
else	Proper solution to be given while giving online/remote technical support which costed me huge time during this complaint.
else	do not replace broken parts with refurbished parts,  I expect to get new parts or replace computer  especially when I pay 2500 euros for a laptop.
else	Update engineers with incident ticket log updates.
else	Better technical expertise on phone
else	I am very much dissatisfied because of the service and dealing from the service provider is very poor.There is no professionalism. They told me to return my device in 2 days it's been 20 days I haven't received it.There way to deal with any customer is not appropriate.Please escalate it to the highest as lots of customers I have seen there are dissatisfied .
else	A Proper Service Center, where there is a professional way to deal with the customer. Compare your service center with the Apple Service Center, in terms of feedback, interaction with customer, understanding the problem.
else	room for improvement on helpdesk and email replying on the response time and knowledge.
else	make return shipments less expensive
Agent	Reaching out to Customer service agent is difficult.
else	Have better trained tech agents who know how to handle returns.  Make sure the product isn't delivered to the customer broken.  Since there was no damage to the box I received the first computer back in, it HAD to have left your shop damaged.
else	Faster delivery of sparepart. Seen from the case ID, spare part delivery was 3 days.
else	Your call in department in Atlanta Georgia is terrible, you cannot hear the representative and the hold times to get to talk to someone can be, and has been extremely long. (although, the last time I called the hold time was a lot better)
else	Double check,before returning work.
else	Send the correct parts to the technicians
else	Provide me with update status.
else	A little better follow up on the part of the phone support tech on the first case is all I'd hope for. Other than that, I'm very satisfied.
else	Had to send back a second time to fix the second issue that was reported the first support call
else	My tablet was returned with the same problem, not working!
else	Frequent availability of parts
else	make available of such parts like mother board, lcd panel, hdd & keyboard with local vendor.
else	Improve sound quality of phones
else	Distribute better replacement parts. The motherboard sent for this service request was defective. Fortunately, disconnecting all power from the original motherboard caused it to reset and the restart problem did not recur.
else	Decrease resolution time.  Improve communication around estimated repair time.  Consider loaner machines during outage period.
else	Send the parts to the technician, not to us.
else	yes, i was not notified via text or email it was shipped, spent an hour with someone from India, only to give me a tracking number, then she said it was delivered Wednesday.  wasted my time, her time and your time as a corporation
else	Pre install software update software
else	It was very hard to navigate the website and find appropriate contacts. The chat facility isn't available for UK customers but that wasn't clear. The phone lines were very poor - I gave up on two occasions as it rang without being answered. Finally on the third attempt I got reasonably good service.
else	After oreo update my phone is more heating & battery drain fast, & full battery charging time approximate 5 hrs. & Phone working slow... I am 3 time visited Lenovo sevice centre & continually calling on costomer care...But my issue is not resolved.
else	Fix the faulty machine before sending a survey, send an engineer as it under full onsite maintenance, instead of just shipping random parts and not telling us what you are shipping!
else	test it more times before you ship back the repaired laptops.
else	Fix, replace, or allow me to return my laptop.
else	Give the parts to the engineer so everything can come at the same time. But it was perfect this time.
else	service has to improve, technical training is required for service team. they are not upto the mark. They are miss leading the customer. they are not aware how to handle the issue. they are damaging the laptop and giving stupid reasons
else	Have better parts availability
else	very bad experience from support team no mail conversation and followup taking lats of time for resolution
else	Better communication, faster repair speed
else	have clearer phone lines with folks who enunciate better
else	better communication specifically responding to requests for updates
else	Have parts in stock!!!!!
else	I got my laptop returned from your service, the laptop could not boot. I shipped it again and received it, it could boot, but the original problem still happened. The paper inside the box mentions your service team has checked everything works OK, but I cannot believe it. YOU SHOULD CONFIRM THE PROBLEM IS FIXED BEFORE RETURNING.
else	Little more feedback
else	less battery DOAs, faster mail in repair
else	Most of the problems came from the hardware so maybe Lenovo can improvise their the quality of their product but.
else	improve quality - sometimes its not fix well and customer send back to services
else	your communication is horrible, e mails never worked, status update makes no sense
else	Poor notes kept between calls at different points. No record of earlier case numbers. Inexperienced person assisting me; didn't know how to discriminate between hardware and software.
else	It was difficult to speak to someone over the phone - support via the web interface was ok but i find it annoying not being able to discuss directly.
else	Just by repairing my PC and inform me about the status. Since I send my Laptop 3 weeks ago I receive no information. (only this survey link)And I do not know where my laptop is.
else	Retrun my calls or emails
else	time taken to have the part replaced was terrible considering it was a known fault
else	Proper safety packaging should be provided before unit is sent in the post
else	ship the correct part in the first attempt. maintain stock of frequently replaced products in local sites
else	Technician should be better knowledge and skill-equipped and diagnose promptly within a framework.of time.
else	Make return shipping less unknown, I would have liked my computer going to my P.O. Box or getting a time of day its delivered.  My computer was freezing cold when I got it, so the fedex truck left it cold.  I left work as soon as I had the delivery notice but would have preferred to be there for delivery if I knew a window.
else	Better knowledge of help desk
else	Please make sure to create a tool to track the status.
else	beater service on time.
else	Keep customer updated with status
else	Better quality control for replacement parts.  The first board installed was defective.  A second board took one week to arrive.
else	Enable tech to have parts, troubleshoot, repair and test without outsourcing parts receiving to users. Tech replaced part that was shipped, but the solution was inadequate for the tech to do their job, i.e. fix what is wrong and return to customer.
else	Have parts in stock
else	Speed of repair at the service centre was not as fast as I expected.
else	Issue closed w/o real resolution yet, updates are too rare
else	return laptop
else	Stock replacement parts.  A customer paying for on-site warranty service should never have to wait more than 48 hours for the technician to show up equipped to perform the repair.
else	please arrange the parts as earliest
else	Give the Lenovo tech the parts he asks for the second request rather than make them have to run multiple more tests. All other items had been tested. This caused a MAJOR delay in having the machine back up and running quickly.
else	Pay more attention to information provided in the ticket updates.
else	Where do I begin. From phone reps to poor search to find update info to no notice computer was being shipped.
else	a little bit slow process requesting parts.
else	Service centre should keep clients updated on the status. I had to call daily to check on the progress.
else	ttitude of service provider is not professional
else	Improve the response time to get a technician the parts and thus allow them to get onsite faster. I had to reach out to my Lenovo Partner Representative to get a faster response as it had been 4 days and no activity update. This is not the case with THINK branded products.
else	the replaced part is not working, and the promised part was not delivered in time
else	Providing customers with a call back as requested when requesting one from tech support (multiple instances with no call back). Adhering to stipulated quotes on time for repair (separate service request), not exceeding deliverables by 47 Business Days. Addressing all technical issues on first service request so customer does not have to spend time waiting on hold to complete repair on Lenovo's behalf.
else	The information given on the phone was inaccurate. I ended up solving the issue by searching on google.
else	I'm so frustrated in repair service not being able to resolve the problem with the microphone failing and going into mute. Tech support check the problem and told me the microphone was bad. So far I've sent my computer to repair twice for the problem and I've been without it for about 6 weeks counting both occurences.
else	At first I was very dissatisfied with the service we received. After some persistence we received the support we felt was fair.
else	Filed engineer is very unprofessional need to work on that. Lenovo partner is also not mature to provide the professional service
else	lacking service delivery communication   part delivery updation on the site
else	I was made to go through multiple steps to try to fix my phone even though I explained I'd already gone through those steps before contacting Moto for help. Most of the emails I received from Motorola or useless.
else	Hardware failed just shy of 24 months, improved parts to prevent this from happening in the future.  I've had the same Mac from 2011 and it works fine!
else	It took too much time to get to a technical expert. I spent time talking to several different people, who went through the same troubleshooting guide, over and over. One of the customer service people even had me completely reset the phone and I lost all my data. When I finally got to the real technical expert, he asked a few questions and said it was a know problem and the phone would have to be replaced.
else	Better tracking of products.
else	Try not pushing faulty bios updates to the laptops and forcing people to download and update the same by saying critical update. This is what broke my laptop. Being no1 laptop maker, I didnt expect this kind of careless silly attitude about what you push as offical updates. Please try fixing this. Now I am afraid to install any official Lenovo software updates.
else	Took too long for the part to come.
else	I am still waiting for my computer to be returned
else	Maybe the repair could have been faster but it was a weekend when i sent it off and a holiday I think so meh I'll let it slide.
else	Information of on-site not updated promptly.
else	Upon completion of the online request, I was not made aware that a part was being shipped to me and the part that was shipped was not the issue to the problem. So the repair man came out (2+ hour drive & was extremely nice) and the part that was shipped was not the part that was needed.  He ordered the part that he felt was the issue, came back out a week later, but unfortunately that did not fix my issue with the video driver.
else	I handed over my handset to service center named voice plus in kottayam for the complaint microphone not working and they returned the handset without resolving the issue. Again I resubmitted and after one week they returned the handset stating that they have terminated the contact with Lenovo. Now I'm taking the handset to Cochin. Very bad experience facing since two weeks.
else	Notify me there was a bios update. I almost returned it because I was tired of the computer locking up.
else	The resolution took too long
else	bring all the right parts on first service call
else	shorten the wait time
else	Have less buttons to push to get to a live person when calling.
else	Provide packaging, and if not at least return the packaging the item was sent in the first place!
else	Took too long for technician to come to the site. over a week when per Lenvo, support was provided with 24 hour or next business day.
else	make sure you have parts in stock, every time I place a service request it takes days
else	Pay for warranty return shipping!!!  ASUS and Samsung Cover shipping.... This is a MAJOR factor in deciding what devices we purchase for our students.  PLEASE STAND BEHIND YOUR PRODUCT.
else	Slow and delayed software updatesDelay in launching new phones
else	Have more communication with the client, the part was received Tuesday and the technician didn't come until the following Monday. I had to call Lenovo multiple times where I was also lied to multiple times.
else	When a support ticket was created and the process was begun to send in my laptop for warranty covered repairs, I was told that a shipping box should arrive in 3 business day. Both times I have had to receive a shipping box it arrived in 5 business days; please adjust the expectation to be 3-5 business days to better customers expectations.
else	The replacement process has been too long and even after 3 weeks it has not been done, nor any updates given. The least you could say is it will take say a month. But none. I emailed 3 times but no responses. Even when there were responses, they were poor, delayed and ill-equipped to solve the problem.
else	Act more helpful with less criticism Obtain Better transport dhl and star track are terrible
else	problem was not resolved , executives received us well
else	even though we have NBD resolve but typically it takes at least 1 day to get the parts arrive and 1 day to schedule the on site tech.  There should be a warehouse close to the tech so they can get the parts within hours and hence the NBD can be archived.
else	Was never provided tracking information. All of a sudden it arrived and let at front door
else	Better communciation among all parties, ahead of appointments
else	Very slow repair turnover time. I was told that typically repairs take about 5 working days. This took more than 2 weeks. I call you and I facebook messaged you, and I was promised by officers that I will get a call back on the status, but there was no callback. I had to call in myself to check the status. Even when the computer is ready, I was not informed. I had to call in to ask before I was told it is ready. After repair, a new issue emerged. The computer would sometimes hang - screen will freeze for a very long time without explanation. Letting it resolve on its own does not work and I have to do a force restart. This has occurred quite a few times already and caused me some inconvenience as my unsaved data might be lost. If it gets worse or intolerable, I will inform you and send it in again for repair. I am busy now and really need the computer, and so I am not doing this now. I cross my fingers and hope that it does not get worse, otherwise, I will complain about you and your deplorable service standards to the media and world.
else	Suggested resolution is not acceptable.
else	fix the problem with the next update or at least put a step by step process of how to fix it on the website
else	Provide updated status online or ANY kind of status thru any means available.  I didn't know it had even been received by service until it was being returned to me.
else	to ensure the parts to be replaced is identical to the customer's product to avoid re-handling
else	For faulty laptops that have been returned more than once to the service centre offer the client a refund
else	keep me better updated on the status of my machine and then don't send it back dinged up and dirty. I'm glad its fixed but extremely disappointed that it has come back scratched and dented when it was sent to you in near mint condition.
else	Firstly too much of delay in the service Center to receive the call(waiting time is very high) and further it took lot of time to get serviced.
else	It took much longer time to get the notebook returned.  After we received the notebook, we found it frozen up in every 20 mins.  Need to return it back again for repair.
else	The support team handled our return quickly with no issues
else	Make the online tracking more detailed and up to date. I had to chat with customer service many times to figure out where my device was. Online, it never said that you aquired it at your facility.
Agent	hold time was a little long.  the announcement message scared you away from staying on the line and scheduling a call back.
else	I have returned the computer and purchased another one from the same store. So far, so good.
else	Do not send updates that do not work
else	clear information and feedback.
else	There was no status updates and no service order number. I had to ask for updates through email.Took one week. There was no warning that my laptop had already been shipped back to me and I nearly didn't receive it. No option to start the repair process through email or chat, only a PAID phone line. Unacceptable. The operator didn't understand half of what I said and I had to correct information by email. The model of my WiFi NIC was changed without warning.
else	Test devices better before returning to the customer.
else	I don't appreciate dealing with reps that don't understand your process and have no problem-solving skills whatsoever.  And do not send me reminders for feedback.  I will give it to you as I see fit.
else	Spare parts availability
else	Need to update Category wise helpline on website/Portal
else	Nobody contacted me.
else	Computer crashed after I tried to do a recommended Lenovo update. I can't help but think that the update caused the issue.
else	better coordination.... parts shipped to two locations.... confused directions to the technician...
else	The spare parts needed are still not shipped over and thus it cant be change
else	This was actually the first time they shipped the wrong part. I was extremely clear about what I needed, but for some reason the wrong part came. In any case the Lenovo on site tech took care of everything. Excellent service, very low hassle for me!
else	Staff was rude and technical team was not qualified to answer properly. Everyone was treating customers like liability on them.
else	clear communication on solution attempted, stay with the customer to confirm resolution and if not successful recommend actions
else	include instructions on how to replace the component being replaced
else	Replace parts are either have some issue or not durable
else	Repalaced parts
else	Make your Lenovo forums more pointed towards resolutions to computer problems that an individual can fix.
else	i already asked tech support to call me. i posted question yesterday on website. . the replacement watch i received 2 days ago is defective also. the charge does not stay long enough.it drains battery rapidly. please contact me at 919-810-6144 asap or via email.
Agent	I was on hold for over 2 hours. I was disconnected after 1 1/2 hours & had to call again. not cool
else	Needs to provide updates regarding product dispatch status.
else	The issue was not resolved and on top of that my laptop was returned with problems that it didn't have when I first sent it. My laptop was damaged in the repair facility, the wifi still did not work and it was returned with a malfunctioning function key. The laptop was returned with two letters each telling me to call different numbers if I was not satisfied. Neither number took me to a rep that seemed able to help me. One rep told me she was sending a label to return the laptop and the label was never sent. I sent the laptop a 2nd time and it was returned in even worse condition! The wifi still does not work, and the computer randomly shuts down and is unable to boot. It is not usable at this time. Now I have to send it a 3rd time. This is my work laptop, and the experience is unacceptable. It is impossible to speak to any sort of manager that will personally take responsibility for getting this machine fixed. Lenovo offers absolutely zero satisfaction for this experience. If this was an airline, I would get a voucher, or a restaurant would give me a free meal. Lenovo keeps making a bad experience worse. Time for a Mac.
else	I asked for updates multiple times and never got a response. I asked for a temporary replacement due to the part not being available and no response. It would have helped me be patient if I knew what was going on but there was nothing. I had to go onto portal and tracking to find out the part was not available and were waiting on part.
else	lack of knowledge of the product of attending engineer
else	I have bought Lenovo k8 note in January 2018. But it's turbo charger have some technical faulty. I have changed my adopter from service center twice. If fault comes continue then warranty comes to end. This shows product can't be trusted. So give good hope to customer by give solving fault in adopter turbo chargingThanks.
else	Improvement in response and resolution time
else	Please send us a product status (via Email or Text) after you receive the laptop from us for the service.
else	Remove the one size fits all instruction sheet that must be returned with the item, it is hard to follow and request information that you should already have.
else	make better parts
else	issue was not resolved, became a depot ticket 407LDLV and that is not currently being addressed either
else	wrong part initially then another problem after first issue was resolved on second attempt
else	Provide direct  telephone support number
else	When I first sent the computer, it came back without any correction. I have expected that at least I would be informed before getting the computer back. After I make a call for explanation, send it back again.
else	Replace the unit. In less than 1 year it is in the second time.
else	a faster turn around or repair will always be good =)
else	Speed up repair times and compensate me for the long wait
else	Please send all parts together
else	Maintain an inventory of replaceable parts. Offer peripherals.
else	Send me my shipping label
else	Incorrect return label was originally issued. Delayed return process.
else	resolve issue re delivering replacement part
else	It was very hard to find the right contact.
else	improve by asking the customer if they would like step by  step  on the phone to solve the issues.
else	It took a long time to receive the part. But once it arrived, Anthony scheduled the appointment timely and was great in resolving the issue.
else	That the product does not need to be returned after 2 months of use
else	The delivery of parts is very slow and often they arrive after the engineer visits.
else	Not return my product with a different language keyboard
else	I did log a complaint over net 1 month back but there was no response. I think need to be more customer centric!
else	Please call or email with an update
else	Better updates - I discovered that the technician needed to ask me a question only because I checked the ticket status.  Did this slow down my repair?  Feels that way
else	Have a faster return time but I understand a lot of the time is used in transit. Good job to the repair person.
else	Make better laptops, this laptop has now been returned twice for different faults and its only 8 months old
else	Either give me better tools to troubleshoot the issue down to a part, send more parts, or don't require I send something to a depot.
else	They need to take the response on mail or call.
else	Make finding self help online easier.Installing updates & drivers
else	Problem was not solved... Graphics driver crashing frequently... Reinstalled original os with windows update and amd updated graphics driver from amd site... Getting no apparent support from Wipro support team... They are saying everything is OK in spite of sharing screenshots.
else	Please send these surveys out when the customer has had the product returned back to them.
else	At this point, accept the return of my thinpad in exchange for a refund.
else	Spare parts management - system or people issue , you find out
else	Actually fix my computer as it has been serviced 5 or 6 times in less than a year. 4 of which are for the same problem.
else	Customer service can improve as I had to phone 3 seperate times to try & get a repair on a tablet that was still under warranty  as only 7 months old. Also improve the tablet it's self as It's the second lenovo tablet I've owned that's had charging issues with not charging properly and taking over 10 hrs!! Unfortunately the 1st tablet didn't get repaired as I didn't have receipt that was 6/7months old aswell and would charge past 13% even tho it would be on charge 24hrs.
else	Make sure the parts you're sending to replace a faulty part for lack of driver/firmware support, has the ability to have firmware updated/installed. You sent me the exact same SSD that has the fault in it due to no firmware...
else	Smartphones are way better than any other at this price but service is not good and Android updates are also too late.
else	Regular updates from the support centre
else	Multiple calls to different numbers. No clear diagnostics.  My impression people putting in their time; , no passion to help.  Hung up on once. No call back. Tech notes lost.  Escalated to supervisor nor did he demonstrate any real interest.
